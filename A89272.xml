         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Rom. 10.18. Acts 14.17. Rom. 2.4. <hi>and ſo precious in thoſe to whom through the Goſpel it ſpiritually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, That it converteth, and bringeth in to Chriſt, and alſo teacheth to deny ungodlineſse and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this preſent life, &amp;c.</hi> Tit. 3.4.5. and 2.11, 12, 13. <hi>Then I hope thou wilt not count it ſtrange, if ſome be heartily grieved, when in a Church, where this great Love is teſtified; And ſet forth in the authorized Doctrine thereof, (many profeſſing themſelves zealous) to ſee them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. So denying and blaſpheming this great love of God to mankind in Scripture affirmed. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 17. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. as if God ever, and from all eternity hated the greateſt number of men, ſo as they neither are beholden to him for any good will, or love, nor have any doore of Repentance or meanes of life opened, and afforded by him in truth for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. So contradicting, and blaſpheming the plain ſayings of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt, as that he gave himſelf <hi>a Ranſome for All Men,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.6. <hi>and by the grace of God, taſted death for</hi> Every Man. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme plainly and directly contrary; as, That Jeſus Chriſt did not die, or ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d his blood for <hi>every man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Calling the Expreſſion in the Doctrin of the Church of England, (that ſaith, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, God the Sonne, hath Redemed me, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,) a flat lye, affirming the truth to be,</hi> hee hath redeemed none but the Elect.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:113535:3"/>
            <p n="4">4. Running into ſo many long agoe condemned, evill and Papiſticall wayes and arguings, to maintaine their Contradictions of Truth. Yea, I ſuppoſe, it would be grievous to thee alſo, to perceive the ſame. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am perſwaded, wilt thou count it ſtrange, that this Love of God beleeved ſhould conſtraine the Beleever in love to beare forth the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereof, and alſo maintaine it againſt oppoſition: yea, and when to the godly and ſober-minded, the ſame is plainly teſtifyed, and the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony ſubſcribed, and yet by others in heat and raſhnes traduced. Then on the importune requeſt of many, to permit it to more open view, that it may be rightly knowne, and ſo tryed, and either approved, or the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours found therein, diſcovered and confuted, which done in love, and by faire dealing with the Scripture, will be lovingly accepted, though the fury of ſuch as have no way, but by incenſing Authority with falſe ſuggeſtions, and evill Reports, (however garniſh'd) to overcome thoſe they oppoſe, cannot be juſtified as Chriſtian; Wherefore Chriſtian and Juditious Reader, if thou conceiveſt me to erre; I hope thy love will leade thee in a Chriſtian way, to ſhew it me by the Scripture, which I will thankfully imbrace; and if thou wilt endeavour the ſame; I then entreat but theſe foure things of thee, which I know the grace of Chriſt beleeved and heeded, will teach thee not to denie mee; And they are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that thou anſwer to the buſineſſe about the matter affirmed: as namely, about the Redemption, Reconciliation and Propitiation wrought by Chriſt in his owne body for men, diſtinct from that he by his Spirit, in application thereof worketh in men, and ſo according to the diſtinction the Scripture maketh, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ntioned in the five firſt Chapters of this enſuing Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly that thou adde not to that I have affirmed of the Death of Chriſt for <hi>All Men,</hi> ſuch things as I neither affirme, nor by any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or reaſonable conſequence can be ſaid to be included in, or to ariſe from my Affirmation, as ſome have done, As that Chriſt ſhould die for all men alike; or that all men ſhall be Eternally ſaved; or that all or any man hath by Nature Free-will to that which is ſpiritually good, or that all that beleeve Chriſt dyed for <hi>All Men,</hi> ſhall be ſaved, all which the Truth affirmed, and the Treatiſe every where condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:113535:3"/>
            <p>Thirdly, that in anſwering, thou be pleaſed to uſe ſpiritual weapons, and right Arguing from plain places of Scripture, compared with other like places, and ſo forbea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thoſe carnall and Popiſh wayes, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Reaſonnings, faulted by ſo many Worthies in this Church.</p>
            <p>As 1. Pretending inſufficiency in the Scripture, to be the determiner of all matters of Faith, but that how plainly ſoever the Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, yet the matter is but <hi>ſub judice,</hi> without ſome other determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Pretending darkneſſe in the Scripture, yea in Fundamentalls, and that of themſelves, however compared with other-like places, they are full of obſcurity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Uſe of carnall Reaſons, to frame abſurdities to follow, if the truth, the plain ſayings of Scripture import, be received and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Impoſing ſtrange ſenſes, on plaine ſayings of Scripture without proof.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Deviſing wayes to maintaine ſuch ſenſes, that they might appeare as if they were proved by Scripture: as to inſtance the moſt common of theſe wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To reſtraine a generall ſenſe, to be meant only of a particular,</hi> as the Papiſts have done in ſome places to maintaine the ſupremacy of the Pope: and the <hi>Socinians,</hi> or new <hi>Arrians</hi> have reſtrained thoſe generall words of <hi>all things,</hi> and <hi>the world,</hi> made by Chriſt, to be meant only of a new Creation, And <hi>all things,</hi> to be only <hi>all the Elect;</hi> And <hi>the world,</hi> to mean <hi>the Church,</hi> or a World of Beleevers; thereby to denie the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, before he took fleſh, and ſo his being God alſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To avoid places ſpeaking of the ſame buſineſſe, to invent reaſons againſt the true ſenſe, and frame another ſenſe out of Places treating of another buſineſs, as ſome have done to deny the Reſurrection, and others to deny their Brethren the reading of the Scriptures, and uſe of ſpirituall gifts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To compare words ſpoken by and of God, and acts done by him, with words ſpoken by, and of men, and acts done by them, as of like large extent and ſignification, as ſome have done to diſhonour God, and to flatter and Idolize men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To addde too, diminiſh from, or alter and mingle the ſenſe and ſentences of Scripture, as ſome for their own ends doe, and the Devill did.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:113535:4"/>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>To ſet one place of Scripture againſt, and in contrariety with another, to make voide the appearing ſenſe in one, that they might chooſe that which beſt liketh them, as hath been uſuall with many Adverſaries to the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>To turne plain places, and Narrations of Scripture into Allegories, it is uſuall with ſuch as uſe to denie the truth of the</hi> litterall Senſe <hi>of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of the Reſurrection, and of ſerving God with our bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>To confound together in one, without diſtinction, ſuch things, and in ſuch reſpects, as the Scripture maketh cleerly diſtinct, as to inſtance ſome of them; The end of Chriſt's Death, and the Application of his Death. And the ſalvation wrought on earth by Chriſt in his own body with God for men; and the ſalvation in the application thereof he worketh from heaven by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit inmen to God;</hi> And God his love of Compaſſion, and his love of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. And Election to Sonſhip, and Predeſtination to the Adoption of Sonnes, And Secret Election in God, and Actuall Election of and by God; And the manner of the Declaration of the Goſpel, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of outward Worſhip.— The portion of Spirit ſent forth before. Chriſt came in the fleſh, and ſince his comming and Aſcention; And ſpirituall gifts, graces, Adminiſtrations, Operations, and outward Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Offices in the Church, &amp;c. <hi>All which the Scriptu e maketh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, but they are uſually confounded by the inconſiderate, and ſuch as denie and darken things appertaining to the Foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>To make ſayings in firſt and ſecond Perſon, and reſtrictive Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Propoſitions for example of like large extent, with ſayings in the Third Perſon generally; and propoſiti ns for the ground of Faith; and uſuall courſe of the unlearned and inconſid rate.</hi>

Being ſuch a publike perſon in the roome and Nature of all mankind, he alſo became for them, under the ſame Law and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which they were, which charged them with ſinne, and bound them over-to puniſhment: By vertue of which his comming under that Law, All the ſinne and puniſhment, The whole debt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by order of Juſtice, became his, whence it is ſaid, <hi>hee was made under the Law to redeem them that were under the Law,</hi> Gal. 4.4, 5. We know that what things ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law, that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world become guilty before God. <hi>Ro.</hi> 3.19. And he becomming under this Law for us, might be rightly challenged with, and arreſted for our debt, whence he is ſaid to have taken upon him the forme of a ſervant. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Being thus in the nature, and ſtead of mankind, under the law for them; God was pleaſed, to challenge the whole debt of him, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113535:8"/>to impute all the ſinnes the Law could charge mankind withall unto him, and to arreſt, and call him to account, and enter into judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with him for all: Whence it is ſaid, God was in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world to himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes to them. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>He laid on him the iniquity of us all,</hi> Eſai. 53.6. <hi>and made him to be ſinne for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. which imputation hee accepted, whence it is ſaid; <hi>he himſelf bare our ſinnes.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. So that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf calls them his, and ſaid, <hi>Innunerable evills have compaſſed me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to look up, they are more then the haires on my head.</hi> Pſal. 40.12.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Having on him our ſinnes, God laid on him the puniſhment and curſe that was due to us for thoſe ſinnes, and hee did ſuffer the ſame curſe, and ſo died as the ſinner, for our ſinnes in the room of us all; <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions.</hi> Eſai. 53.5. <hi>Hee was made a curſe for us.</hi> Gal. 3.13. <hi>Chriſt dyed for our ſinnes according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.4. <hi>hee ſuffered for our ſinnes, the juſt for the unjuſt.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. Chriſt died for the ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 6. hee died for all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. and ſo by the grace of God, taſted death for every man. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. which is in account with God, and thoſe that are taught it of him, as if all had died. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Having thus ſuffered, and dyed for our ſinnes, he, even the ſame that dyed, roſe againe the third day according to the Scriptures. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.4. and ſo roſe juſtified, and acquit of all our ſinnes imputed to him, and a Triumphant Victorer over curſe and death, and all the enemies of our Salvation: Declared to be the Son of God, with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer according to the Spirit of Holineſſe, by the reſurrection from the dead. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. was raiſed for our juſtification. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. put to death in the fleſh, but quickened by the Spirit. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. Juſtified in the Spirit. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. the Juſt One. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. having ſpoiled Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallities and Powers, and made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in himſelf. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. and ſo gave himſelf a ranſome, and a propitiatory ſacrifice to God his Father, for all men. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2.</p>
               <p n="8">8. All this his Oblation and Sacrifice of himſelf to God, did hee ſanctifie and dignifie, through the oneneſſe of his will with the will of his Father, he having one and the ſame will, minde and purpoſe with his Father, in all this: <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.5.10. And by vertue of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, and Aeternall Spirit, through which he offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113535:8"/>without ſpot to God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. He that hath offered himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. and man. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. yea, God man in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.23. So that by reaſon, of this perſonall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the divine and humane nature in one Perſon, the blood that was ſhed, and with which he is entred the heavens, to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God for us, is called <hi>Gods own blood: Act.</hi> 20.28. Which is more then if all and every man in the world had ſuffered all that was due to their ſinnes, and is accepted of God at the hands of Chriſt, as if all had died. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. So as this redemption is in Chriſt perfect, the worke accompliſhed and done, and the Father with him, and in him is well pleaſed. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. he having now taken away ſinne, and aboliſhed death. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. <hi>And is now at the right hand of God the Father, who hath releaſed and given over all into his diſpoſe, and made him Lord of all.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18.22. Act. 10.24.36.</p>
               <p>And this is the ſalvation which Jeſus Chriſt hath wrought in his owne body with God for men; which all creatures in heaven and earth could not have done, but Jeſus Chriſt hath done it, and ſo hath anſwered that part of Gods will, <hi>who will have all men ſaved.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>in that hee hath given himſelf a ranſome for all;</hi> Yet if there be not a Salvation alſo wrought in men, they will yet periſh in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death, having no power in themſelves to come to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a Reconciliation, Redemption, and Salvation which Jeſus Chriſt effecteth by his Spirit in men to God; of which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, when in affirming the former wrought, men are thereupon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to ſuffer the Spirit in the newes thereof, to effect this latter in them: <hi>Wee pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be yee reconciled to God.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20. <hi>and receive not this grace of God in vaine.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.1. Whence the confeſſion of the Saints is, <hi>Thou haſt Redeemed us unto God by thy blood, out of every, &amp;c.</hi> Revel. 5.9. The former was by Blood-ſheading, This by blood-ſprinking, or waſhing, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.9. and 1.5. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19.24. and 12.24. Whence theſe are ſaid, <hi>To be Elect according to the fore-knowledge of God the Father, through Sanctification of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, unto obedience and ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.2. and ſo it is ſaid, <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth.</hi> Joh. 6.63. <hi>The Spirit giveth life, and writeth the Epiſtle of Chriſt in the heart, and conformeth to Chriſt</hi> 2 Cor. 323.6.17, 18. <hi>The law of the Spirit of Lafe in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the law of ſinne, and of death.</hi> Rom. 8.2. and ſo ſuch are ſaid to be <hi>waſhed, and ſanctified, and juſtified in the

Phil. 2.1.12, 13.</p>
               <p>For effecting of which Redemption, Reconciliation, and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Jeſus Chriſt is exalted at Gods right hand. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.33. <hi>him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> Acts 5.31.

               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of God offended with mankind, The end of the death of, and ranſome given, and Sacrifice offered by Chriſt, was to fulfill the truth, and ſatisfie the Juſtice, and performe that good will of God, who would have all men ſaved: Mankind having ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fallen, the truth of God will have it ſo, That hee that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth muſt the: And the Juſtice of God will have it ſo, That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Now God may bring men into a new Treaty, and ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and extend Peace to them: his truth and Juſtice as brightly ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therein, as his Mercy and Peace: Chriſt his Sonne, having in mans nature and ſtead, fulfilled his Truth, and ſatisfyed his Juſtice: and ſo farre ſaved all men, according to his will. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.

               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediatour between God and man; The end of the death of, ranſome given, and ſacrifice offered by JESUS CHRIST, was, <hi>that he might be the Lord of All, have them all as his owne, to diſpoſe and judge, to command, and accordingly to condemne, or forgive, as he ſaw fit: Chriſt was the Lord of all, as the Father, for all were created by him.</hi> Joh. 1.1, 2, 3. <hi>But mankind, being fallen into ſinne, and ſo under death and curſe, became without Chriſt, and without God in the world; Alienated from his favour and preſence:</hi> Ephe. 2.1, 2, 12. Gene. 3.24. <hi>and became dead in ſinne.</hi> Rom. 5.12, 18. <hi>And though God and Chriſt, loſt not their right of Lordſhip over men, yet man being fallen, the liberty of exerciſe was on mans part barred: and there was no way but one, that God and Chriſt ſhould judge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroy mankinde for the ſinne, and in the verſe and death, under which they were fallen; mankind being now, like a fallon and Traytor, with ſentence paſt upon him, and upon the ladder or Tree, with the rope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his neck, and ready to be turned off, having neither benefit of Law, nor Pardon; nor freind among all the Creatures that can helpe him, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113535:15"/>ſo no way for favour, or comming into any new treaty or Judgement, or living to God any more: but onely in this new way agreed on between God and Chriſt. That Chriſt ſhould take this cauſe in hand, beare this ſinne, goe upon the ladder, and ſuffer this death and curſe upon the tree; whioh he once having ſuffered and overcome, all mankind ſhould be his, and he become their Lord, that they might live to him: and ſo be all brought out of this firſt death by him; And thoſe that did in the day of grace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him for Lord, and yeeld to his government, hee might give them æternall life, and thoſe that would not ſo doe, he might ſentence them to a ſecond death.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. Gal. 3.13. <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Alſo mankind in their ſinne and fall, by reaſon of the conqueſt Sathan had over them therein, were become his ſlaves, and vaſſalls, and hee by his conqueſt and power, got ſuch intereſt and maſtery over man, that hee was their Lord by the right of warre: Now Jeſus Chriſt, by his conqueſt over the Devill in the wilderneſſe, and through his life, and by his Reſurrection, and in his Aſcenſion, did overthrow the Devill, and conqvered him, and ſpoiled him of all his right of Lordſhip, and led Captivity captive, and ſo himſelfe became Lord by vertue of his conqueſt alſo:</hi> Mat. 4. Jo. 12.31. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8. <hi>ſo hath he redeemed all men, by purchaſe and ranſome of his Father, and by ſtrong hand, and conqueſt, from the Devills right of Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and ſo is the Lord of all men by a double right, namely of ranſome and conqueſt, and hath all into his diſpoſe, and for a new treaty. And all ſhall be made alive to ſtand at his judgement; and he hath a new and æternall life to beſtow on all that in the day of grace doe in beleeving ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his Spirit: And another, even a ſecond death for ſuch as through the day of grace rebell againſt him; and hee is the Judge: and ſo it is ſaid,</hi> For to this end Chriſt both dyed, and roſe and revived, that he might be the Lord both of the dead and living. <hi>Ro.</hi> 14.9.12. <hi>And that he dyed for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him that dyed for them, and roſe againe.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.15. <hi>Whether wee live therefore, or dye, wee are the Lords.</hi> Rom. 14.8. <hi>And wee muſt all appear before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10. Rom. 14.11, 12. <hi>And then all ſhall acknowledge him that dyed to be Lord, and hee ſhall judge.</hi> Phil. 2.7, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In reſpect of mankind, for whom Chriſt did mediate, The end of the death of, the ranſome given, and ſacrifice offered by Chriſt, was,—To remove out of the way, all that ſtood between God and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113535:15"/>man, which was as a barre that kept back all ſtreames of mercy and peace; that none tending to ſalvation could be ſhewne to man; as, the bondage of the Law, that held under ſinne, the power of death, that lay on man by reaſon of ſinne, and the Lordſhip and power of the devill, that held under both: And ſo Chriſt dyed for all, that all are dead. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. And wee are dead to the Law by the body of Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. and he hath aboliſhed death by his comming. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. In a word, hee hath blotted out the hand-writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances that was againſt us, and contrary to us, and took it out of the way, having ſpoiled Principallities and Powers, &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14, 15.—Alſo he dyed, and offered himſelfe in Sacrifice, To procure pardon and remiſſion of ſinnes, and favour and life into his owne hands for mankind, that hee might diſpoſe thereof according to the Tenor of the Goſpel: For without ſhedding of blood is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes. <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 9.22. And hee was delivered (to death) for our offences. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25.—Alſo that hee might open a way for men to come in and partake of this grace, through his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the Goſpel; In which hee is ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 3.25. In which Goſpel hee hath brought life and Immortallity to light. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. That in the Teſtimony thereof, all men might through him beleeve. <hi>John</hi> 1.7. and in beleeving, have life. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>And all theſe three ends, that in reſpect of God, that in reſpect of Chriſt, and that in reſpect of mankind, are all for the good of mankinde, and meet all in this one end of his death, for ranſome, ſacrifice, propitiation. And this is affirmed in the Scripture through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; And each particular in this generall, to be for the world, for all men, for every man, and ſo, and for ſuch ends, and in ſuch ſenſe, appeares. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. to be meant: And ſo the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is alſo to be taken: yet are there other ends of his death: and ſo.</p>
               <p>The ſecond end of the Death, and blood-ſhedding of CHRIST was to ſeale, rattify and confirme the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes; whence it is called, <hi>The New Teſtament in his blood, which was ſhedd, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 22.20. and his blood, called <hi>the blood of the New Teſtament.</hi> Mat. 26.28. <hi>That Chriſt is come, and hath dyed for our ſinnes, and roſe for our juſtification, and is the Propitiation for the</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:113535:16"/>ſinnes of the World; That he is the Lord, and all men are his, and ought to live to him, and that there is life in him for them, Is the affirmation and Declaration of the Goſpel, and ſhall one day be knowne to be true, whether men will beleeve it or no; But for ſuch as through grace doe beleeve it, ſo that in that beleeving they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and come in to Chriſt, and depend on him, There are for them many precious and gracious Promiſes from Chriſt, and his Father. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.6. contained in one generall, which is of <hi>æternall life.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.25. and branched into many particulars, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million of ſinnes, ſubduing of luſts, Sanctification, hearing of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, preſervation in this Grace, and guidance, and protect on of ſpirit, through all ſeruices of him, and ſuffeſings for him, and to the poſſeſſion of the Inheritance, &amp;c. as before inſtanced: A I which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Covenant, or as in a Will and Teſtament plainly recorded, are called <hi>the New Teſtament:</hi> Gal. 3.17, 18. of which Teſtament, Chriſt is the Mediator. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. And where a Teſtament is, there muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be the death of the Teſtator; for a Teſtament is of force after men are dead, otherwiſe it is of no ſtrength at all, while the Teſtator li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.16, 17. but the Teſtator once dead, if it be but a mans Teſtament, yet if it be confirmed, no man diſannulleth, or addeth thereto. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15. How much more this Teſtament of Chriſt, ſealed with his blood. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8. and 9, 10. And this end peculiarly is for, and belongeth to his Called and choſen ones. That they which are called, might receive the Promiſe, &amp;c. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.15. and 10.19. Such as have in beleeving received the Atonement. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.3.11. This end joyned with the former, is the ground of their hope.</p>
               <p>The third end of the death of Chriſt, was to be a witneſſe-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a ſeale of the witneſſe he had borne to the Truth, in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and miniſtration of the Goſpel, as he ſaith, <hi>To this end was I borne, and for this cauſe came I into the world, That I ſhould beare witneſſe to the Truth.</hi> Joh. 18.37. ſo it's ſaid, <hi>Hee before</hi> Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>witneſſed a good confeſſion:</hi> 1 Tim. 6.13. <hi>or profeſſion;</hi> And in this end was included the teſtimony of his faithfulneſſe, and obedience alſo to his Father. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.50. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. And the Teſtimony of his compaſſion and care for the good of <hi>All,</hi> where he had preached the Goſpel. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.35.38. And the Teſtimony of his more ſpeciall love, and tender care and faithfulneſs toward thoſe given him in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113535:16"/>heavenly Call by his miniſtration, watching to preſerve them in the Truth, even to the Adventuring, and laying downe his life for them. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.11, 18. which end in reſpect of teſtimony more neerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected them among whom hee miniſtred, and by inſtruction, us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; But eſpeciall is this end, and the holding of it forth alſo for our example, <hi>to lay downe our lives for the Brethren.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.16.

Nor yet as the ſeale of the New Teſtament, Hee onely did that, and his blood is that for all his called and <hi>choſen Ones.</hi> Heb. 9.12, 14, 15, 16, 17. But in witneſſe-bearing to the truth, In love and teſtimony of faithfulneſſe to Brethren: To goe on and be faithfull in all ſervices of love, for edifying in faith and love, even to the death, and laying downe our lives for the Brethren. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 8.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Some ſay, JESUS CHRIS dyed for all his Elect, and onely for thoſe that are elect to <hi>Sonne-ſhip,</hi> and eternall, Inheritance, and for no other; Not for <hi>all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. Some ſay JESUS CHRIST dyed for all men alike, wrought redemption for them all alike, with like love, and like intention, and for like ends. But as this hath no ground in the Scripture, ſo it is already ſhewne confuted by it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some ſay, JESUS CHRIST dyed for every man, in caſe every man beleeve on him, and for no man to Salvation, in caſe every man perſiſt in unbeleife. But this is no Scripture ſenſe, and imperfect to make any ſenſe to goe on with at all; for <hi>Chriſt hath dyed, and given himſelf a Kanſome to God for all men,</hi> whether any man beleeve it or no; and hath by his death ſo purchaſed all men of God, that hee is become their Lord, and ſhall judge them, though they ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in unbeliefe; neither ſhall they all ſo perſiſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9, 12. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.11.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113535:24"/>not the Queſtion, which is, not about what good all doe receive from or by the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but what good hee hath thereby wrought and procured for all men, that he might have pou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And if he be not the Propitiation for their ſinnes, how ſhall he judge them according to the Goſpel, and by it? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.47, 48. and if no price be paid, nor Propitiation made for them, but that what ever reprievall patience or mercies they receive, they will but aggravate their condemnation, no doore of Repentance and life being opened in truth for them, to which this patience and bounty might leade them: what good doe they then receive; or rather be they not neceſſarily more miſerable? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some ſay JESUS CHRIST ſo dyed for all, that his death is ſufficient for all, and applicable to all; but not ſo as he hath indeed ranſomed all men, and become the propitiation for their ſinnes: The Affirmative part of this ſenſe is very good, and will ſtand well: But the Negative both croſſeth plain Teſtimonies of Scripture; and alſo denieth and unſaith the Affirmative againe; for what ſufficiency is there applicable from Chriſt, or by his Servants, for or to any man, of any thing that Chriſt hath not firſt perfectly wrought, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in himſelf, that he might according to the Goſpel, beſtow it on them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18.19, 20.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Some ſay JESUS CHRIST dyed for all men, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the kind or generall lumpe of Mankind conſidered; becauſe he took the Nature of all mankind, and ſo dyed for all; But that he did not dye for all in reſpect of the Individualls: not for every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man: But here is a denying in truth of what was equivocally granted; nor is this according to Scripture ſenſe, but very croſſe to it, in the negative. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.9.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That that was the very minde, will, and intention of Chriſt and God, that Chriſt ſhould even ſo die for <hi>All, that they might be ſaved,</hi> Joh. 3.17. and that for that end he came and dyed, and roſe. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.56. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That his death was ſufficient for this very end. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the death, and ſo the Ranſome of Chriſt was effectuall with his Father, for the end for which it was given. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That he hath received of the Father, fulneſſe of authority, and ſpirit to make this grace knowne to them, with ſuch tenders of it, that they might he ſaved <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That he will extend light at ſome-time, in ſome meanes or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo farre to every one, that whoſoever periſh, their deſtruction will be of themſelves. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.4, 5.9. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9.</p>

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:113535:25"/>
               <p>According as I underſtand, the Queſtion is here in the firſt Affirmation rightly Stated: The ſenſe true and full; and by the addition: The diſtinction made between the Salvation that was wrought by CHRIST, in his owne body with GOD for men, and that Salvation, which in application of the former, hee worketh by his Spirit in men, whereby Repentance and Faith is effected. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31, 32. and a way and poſſibility of that alſo, for every man is at firſt affirmed in this Affirmation, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the common Salvation before mentioned.</p>
               <p>So that JESUS CHRIST hath ſo dyed, and given himſelf, a Ranſome to GOD <hi>for all men, and is become the Propitiation for their ſinnes:</hi> That in and by himſelf, hee hath ſo Redeemed and ſaved <hi>all men,</hi> That they are all given into his diſpoſe, and he will raiſe them <hi>all</hi> out of the Death hee dyed for them, and ſet them alive before him, that they ſhall acknowledge him LORD, and come before his Judgement ſeat. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9, 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 22. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19.10.</p>
               <p>And he is alſo ſo filled with Spirit for them, to make it ſo known, and with ſuch tenderneſſe to them, <hi>that they might be ſaved;</hi> in which <hi>hee will he found Faithfull, ſo as by him</hi> All <hi>are made ſaveable.</hi> Pſal, 68 18. Joh. 1.4, 5, 9. Iſai. 45.21.22.</p>

The firſt man was made a living ſoul, who might have ſtood, and ſo with him, all naturally theſeending from him; but no power, if fallen, to riſe and live again;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:113535:28"/>The laſt <hi>Adam</hi> was made a <hi>quickning Spirit,</hi> ſo as he might be able not onely to riſe from the death himſelf, but to quicken and raiſe thoſe fallen and dead; The firſt man of the earth, made of the duſt, and by his fall, became more earthy, returning to duſt againe, weak and mortall; The <hi>Second Man,</hi> the LORD from heaven, who though for mankind dying, yet could not be holden of death, and being riſen, can die no more, but liveth ever. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45, 48. <hi>with Gene.</hi> 2.7. <hi>and</hi> 3.19. <hi>and Acts.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.18.

So that there is an abundance in Chriſt; beyond that which appeares in the Type, Shaddow or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; ſo that therein Chriſt commeth not ſhort, but goeth beyond the figure, in that wherein it figured him: So that the Redemption and reſtauration wrought in and by himſelf, in his owne body for men, is not onely as full and large, as the fall by <hi>Adam,</hi> in and of himſelf, but much more full and large: For though, by one offence in him, ſinne entred, yet the Pardon procured by Chriſt, and in his

               <p>And yet to open the ſenſe a little more fully, conſider the uſe of the word.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p>Secondly, And beleevers, that are regenerate, are alſo called <hi>men,</hi> and that even becauſe they are ſo. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22. And they are alſo ſo called, in reſpect of ſome weakneſſes, and paſſions. <hi>Acts</hi> 14, 15. and ſometime in reſpect of ſome carnall walkings. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. But yet Beleevers are in Scripture called ſomething more, and better then <hi>men,</hi> even the <hi>Sonnes of God.</hi> Joh. 1.12. 1 Joh. 3.1. and <hi>Saints.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. and <hi>Brethren, and faithfull in Chriſt.</hi> Epheſ. 1.1. yea, <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Acts 11.26.</p>

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe this is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15.</p>
               <p>And thus it is cleer, the force of the words carries it, <hi>to all Adams ſonnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the Circumſtances in the place, from the fore-going and following verſes, doe carry it to the very ſame ſenſe already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> that exhorteth <hi>Timothy,</hi> and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches alſo in exhorting him, and to be exhorted by him, <hi>to pray for All men;</hi> And they are the Churches, even the Beleevers, that are to pray <hi>for all men:</hi> And they are others, <hi>even all men,</hi> ſet forth in the third Perſon generally, that are to be prayed for: he ſaith not for, <hi>of all forts ſome;</hi> but <hi>for all men:</hi> and naming but one ſort of men, which in thoſe times might be moſt of all doubted of, he expreſly ſaith, <hi>all of them.</hi> verſ. 1, 2.</p>

               <p n="2">2. That this is the ſenſe of <hi>all men,</hi> here appeares by the Apoſtles care to ſettle the Beleevers in this perſwaſion: That it is good in the ſight of God, <hi>to pray for all men:</hi> praying for their brethren, could not be doubted of them, to be good in the ſight of God; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>all men,</hi> unbeleevers, perſecutors and oppoſers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, many <hi>weake ones</hi> might doubt it, which doubt he labours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6. ſuitable to that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44, 48.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This farther appeares by the motives by which hee induceth them to pray for all men, which are onely from Gods good will, and love to manward, and what in Chriſt, he hath do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But this Argument hath no force, for <hi>Paul</hi> here directeth to pray for <hi>All men,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſheweth us how long wee may pray for ſome, even till they be known to have ſinned the ſinne unto death. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.16. And what is that ſinne unto death, but that willing treading under foot, and caſting aſide, and offering diſpite to, or blaſpheam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grace of God procured for them, by the Death and Ranſome of Chriſt, and tendered to them with light and power in the means, till one be given up of God. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.5, 6. and 10.29. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. And till this be ſo knowne, even thoſe were to be prayed for. And ſo this Argument is turned againſt it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But there are two evill conſequences ariſe from the Propoſitions, ſo, and to ſuch an end framed: The one to colour that Impious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, of <hi>praying for the dead,</hi> That are knowne to be <hi>Elect,</hi> if the <hi>All</hi> we are to pray for, were as large as the <hi>All</hi> Chriſt gave himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for; The other of faſtening an errour in the heart, of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and equalling man with God; as if all men, and every man were no larger in Gods view, and in oppoſition to him, then in the view of men, and oppoſition to them.</p>
               <p>And to take away both, one ſaying may ſerve: Needfull it is, that the foundation be large enough to beare all the ſtones that are to be layed on it; but not needfull that every ſtone ſhould be equall to the foundation in length and breadth, whether applyed to Perſons, Doctrines or Uſes: So that <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf a Ranſome for all men;</hi> Is a good ground for us <hi>to pray for all men in our times, as it was for them before us in their times; and will be for thoſe after us in their times:</hi> But to reaſon croſsly thus. <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf a Ranſome for no more, then wee now, living may pray for, or thoſe written to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, the Goſpel of this Reconciliation wrought by God in Chriſt, was Preached by Chriſt in the world, that men might have beleeved it, and in beleeving, have been by him reconciled to God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11. And now Chriſt is gone up to heaven, he hath left his Servants in the Work, in his place, for miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hath put his Word in their hearts, that they might declare it in, and to the World; that men might beleeve this Reconciliation wrought <hi>with God for men, in Chriſt, and therethrough, be reconciled to God by Chriſt.</hi> verſe 20, 21. and chap. 6.1, 2. compared with. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.15.18.21, 23.</p>
               <p>So that this Reconciliation, already wrought by God in Chriſt, to be declared for ſo gracious an end, Is without all Controvercy, <hi>for the world,</hi> but what World, let the Text ſhew, — <hi>The world of mankind.</hi> verſe 11.

               <p>Joh. 1.9. <hi>He is the true light, which lighteneth every man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the world;</hi> here againe it is evident, That through the Ranſome given, and propitiation made by Chriſt, and the life, light and redemption in him thereby for men, There is life obtained, and a doore of hope opened, and ſome mercy extended, and ſome light at ſome time vouchſafed <hi>to every one that commeth into the world:</hi> But what World?

               <p>But that this matter may yet more plainly appear, let us view what the holy Ghoſt ſaith of the World, in this reſpect; and that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the world in generall. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lambe of God which taketh away the ſinnes of the world.</hi> Joh. 3.17. <hi>God ſent not his Sonne into the world, to condemne the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved.</hi> Joh. 4.42.</p>

               </p>

               <p>And now, if we couple with the death of Chriſt, as the Ranſome and Propitiation, This end of it, <hi>That he might be the Lord of All;</hi> and that all might live to him, and therein become ſaveable, and ſo be made alive before him, as to receive Abſolution, or condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him; what ſaith the Scripture?</p>
               <p>Rom. 1 4.9. <hi>To this end Chriſt both dyed, and roſe and revived, That he might be the Lord both of the dead, and of the Living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Cor. 5.14, 15. <hi>VVee thus judge, that if One dyed for all, then were all dead: And that he dyed for All; that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him that dyed for them, and roſe againe.</hi>

               <p>And if wee look on them that ſtumble at Chriſt in his Goſpel and refuſe and denie him, doth not the Scripture ſay, <hi>Such</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11.) <hi>periſh, for whom Chriſt dyed.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.1. <hi>even denying the LORD that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction;</hi> And are they not ſaid, To have troad under foot the Sonne of God, and count the blood of the Covenant, wherewith they were ſanctified, an unholy thing, and to offer deſpight unto the Spirit of Grace. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.29. and to be <hi>trees twice dead,</hi> Jude 12.</p>
               <p>And if wee look upon the accompliſhment of this end of the death of Chriſt, doth not the Scripture ſay. <hi>Before him ſhall be gathered all Nations, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 25.32, 40. and that even becauſe, to that end hee dyed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9.11, 13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 11. <hi>and roſe:</hi> And ſo, <hi>in the Name of</hi> JESUS, <hi>every knee ſhall bow, and every tongue ſhall confeſſe, that</hi> JESUS <hi>is the LORD, &amp;c.

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Scripture, in ſuch places as.</hi> 1 Tim. 2.6. Hebr. 2.9. <hi>and</hi> Joh. 4.42. <hi>Are not to be underſtood in the ſenſe which the words ſeem to Import; And this</hi> Objection <hi>is fortifyed with divers Reaſons,</hi> as to inſtance the chief of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The words of Scripture cannot be alwayes taken in the ſenſe they Import;</hi> as, <hi>I am the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ine, I am the Doore, This is my Body.</hi>

                  <p>For the Affirmation, which is the <hi>Objection</hi> it ſelf, the contrary may be affirmed, for though the Scripture ſpeaketh ſometime more plainly, ſometimes Metaphorically, and ſometime Parabollically, and Figuratively; yet alway truly, and in that very ſenſe the words ſo ſpoken, and as the place in which the words are, and the buſineſe about which they treat, doe Import; <hi>For God is a God of truth, and Chriſt is the Truth.</hi> Pſal. 31.5.

Is the Spirit of Truth. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.6. and 5.6. and the Word of God, both eſſentiall and inſtrumentall, is Truth. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.17. and the Word of Truth. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.5.

And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles renounced the hidden things of diſhoneſty; not walking in craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, nor handling the Word of God deceitfully; but by manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the Truth, commending themſelves to every mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in the ſight of God. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. and ſpake the Words of Truth and ſeberneſſe. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.25. And that with great plainneſſe of ſpeech; and not with a vaile over their face neither. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12, 13. and the Scripture tells us, <hi>That hee that hateth, diſſembleth with his lippes. Prov.</hi> 26.24.

Yet the myſteriouſneſſe of the Scriptures ſtands not in any equivocall hiddenneſſe, and doubtfulneſs of ſpeech, like the Oracles of the Heathens ſuppoſed gods, that by the witt of men, might be made true, which way ſoever taken, though contrary to what they imported, to thoſe that ſought and truſted to them; but the Scriptures, though myſterious, yet ſo full of unchangable truth,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:113535:43"/>that when by the ſpirit of grace, the knowledge thereof is ſo given to any man, that he underſtands the ſame: It will appeare to be ſo right and plain, and juſt, according to the words, in which it was expreſt, That he that underſtands will ſay, <hi>As I have heard, ſo have I found in the houſe of God.</hi> Pſal. 48.8. and will not contradict, but confeſſe the truth of Chriſts own ſayings. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.6, 9. <hi>Heare, for I will ſpeak of excelient things, and the opening of my lippes ſhall be right things, for my mouth ſhall ſpeak truth, and wickedneſſe is an abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to my lippes: And the words of my mouth are in righteouſneſſe.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing froward, or wreathed, or perverſe in them.

                  <head>II. The Second REASON.</head>
                  <p>That the words <hi>All,</hi> and <hi>Every man,</hi> ſometime meane <hi>but ſome:</hi> This Reaſon is already anſwered, and proved vaine and fraudulent in Chap 5. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If in a thouſand places, where the oppoſition is not between God and men in generall, as in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. nor the ſpeech of God and by God, as in the places already inſtanced. Then it is not at all to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The words <hi>All men,</hi> and <hi>Every man,</hi> when it is ſpoak by God, and of his works, and the oppoſition between God and men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, whether it ſpeak of the Creation of men by Chriſt, The fall of men in <hi>Adam,</hi> The Ranſome given for men by Chriſt: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of men, or their account giving to him, is never found to mean leſſe then <hi>All men,</hi> and every man, which proves the fraud of this reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The words <hi>All men,</hi> and <hi>Every man,</hi> being alwayes taken in the largeſt ſenſe, the ſcope of the place, the buſineſſe treated on, and the Circumſtances therein, and ſentence in which the words are uſed, will beare, as is ſhewn before: Chap. 5. and no larger affirmed here;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:113535:45"/>This Argument is turned againſt it ſelf; that it muſt needs be ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Reaſon, That the death of Chriſt is often ſaid to be but <hi>for many,</hi> and thoſe <hi>many,</hi> his Sheep.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Reaſon is weake, and of no force, for the word <hi>many</hi> is oft ſo uſed, That it both ſignifies <hi>All,</hi> and <hi>Every man,</hi> and alſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifieth, or ſetteth forth the greatneſſe of that Number, as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth, ſhall awake</hi> Rom. 15.19. <hi>Through the offence of one, many be dead, by one mans diſibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience many were made ſinners:</hi> and in other places, where <hi>many</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nor is by any Chriſtian underſtood for leſſe then <hi>All men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Reaſon is equivocall, ſubtill, and fraudulent; ſeeing where <hi>All men,</hi> and <hi>Every man</hi> is affirmed of, The Death of Chriſt, as the Ranſome and Propitiation, and the fruits thereof onely, is affirmed for them.</p>
                  <p>But where the word <hi>many</hi> is in any place uſed in this buſineſſe, there are more ends of the Death of Chriſt, then this one affirmed of, as before is ſhewne at large, in Chap. 2. and 3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Reaſon is falſe and ungodly, for it is no where in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt dyed, or gave himſelf a Ranſome but</hi> for many, <hi>or</hi> onely for many, <hi>or</hi> onely for his Sheep; <hi>and it is ungodlineſſe to adde, to, or diminiſh from the Words of GOD in SCRIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>T<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Reaſon is deceitfull and erroneous; for the Scripture doth no where ſay, Thoſe <hi>many</hi> he dyed for, are his Sheep, (much leſſe his Elect, as the Reaſon intends it.) As for the place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.15. uſually inſtanced to this end, it's therein much abuſed; for our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.—Did not ſet forth the difference between ſuch as he dyed for, and ſuch as he dyed not for: or ſuch as he dyed for ſo, and ſo, and not ſo, and ſo: but the difference between thoſe that beleeve on him, and thoſe that beleeve not on him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5, 14, 26, 27. one heare his voice, and follow him, the other not, —Nor did our Saviour here ſet forth the priviledges of <hi>All he dyed for,</hi> or for <hi>whom he dyed for</hi> ſo and ſo but of thoſe that beleeve on him, through the Miniſtration of the Goſpel, and ſo to know him, and approach to God, and enter the Kingdome by him <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4, 9.27.—Nor was
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:113535:45"/>our Saviour here, ſetting forth the excellency of thoſe for whom hee dyed, or dyed for ſo, and ſo onely, wherein they are preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others; but the excellency of his owne love, with the fruits thereof, to thoſe (not onely that he dyed for, but alſo) that are brought in by his Miniſtration, to beleeve on him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.27.—Nor was our Saviour here treating ſo much of his Ranſome giving, and Propitiation making, as of his Miniſtration of the Goſpel, and ſo of his love and faithfulneſſe therein, wherein hee laid downe his life for thoſe miniſtred too, and therein gave us example, not to make Propitiation for ſinne, but to teſtify Love in ſuffering.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the oppoſition appeares here to be, not ſo much between Elect and Not-Elect, as between Jewes called, and Gentiles uncal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, there is in Scripture great difference, between <hi>ſheep,</hi> and <hi>ſheep of his flock and paſture,</hi> of which he here ſpeaketh. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5, 11, 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, <hi>ſheep,</hi> verſ. 4.5, 11, 15. are not mentioned, as all thoſe for whom he dyed, but as thoſe that by his miniſtration are brought in to beleeve and enjoy the benefit of his death, and to whom hee miniſtreth and communicateth ſpirit. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4, 27. <hi>like that</hi> John 17.6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, here is more ends of his death mentioned, then Ranſom, or Propitiation onely: and yet it is not ſaid, <hi>onely for his ſheep:</hi> and when the Ranſome or Propitiation is onely mentioned, It is ſaid, <hi>for all men,</hi> ſo that this reaſon appeares weak, fraudulent, ungodly and erroneous.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For the Affirmation: that there was great reaſon that ſuch generall words, as <hi>All men, Every man,</hi> and <hi>the World,</hi> ſhould be uſed in thoſe times, when Chriſt and his Apoſtles were upon the earth, when they meant but ſome, even Gods <hi>Elect</hi> and <hi>choſen</hi> among <hi>All Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is as evill as all the Reaſons before, and as groſſe as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection it ſelf; for though there be a holy and ſpirituall wiſedome and Prudence to be obſerved in ſpeeches and carriages, in reſpect of the evilneſſe of ſome times: <hi>Amos</hi> 5.13. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.5, 7. <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.13.16. Yet the holy Scripture doth furniſh us hereto, for all times, and is able (through Faith) to make the Beleever wiſe unto Salvation,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:113535:46"/>and the man of God perfect to every good worke. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 17.</p>
                  <p>But that any other doctrine, or contrary Words, ſhould be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to deliver the Goſpel within theſe times, Is monſtrous to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and expreſly contradictory to the Scripture Commands.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, according as it is written, Thoſe, whoſe faith wee are to follow, are ſuch whoſe word and Converſation hath this end, To hold forth in the Goſpel JESUS CHRIST, <hi>the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</hi> Heb. 13.7, 8. And as Jeſus Chriſt is that Eſſentiall Word of God, which endureth for ever: for is the Word of the Goſpel, which came forth of the mouth of God, and declareth Chriſt; That created and inſtrumentall Word of God, which in the truth, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, certainty, and goodneſſe of it, <hi>endureth for ever.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23, 25. And though this Goſpel came forth leſſe largely and cleerly at the firſt. <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3.15. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 2. yet after, more fully and clearly to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.

Deutr.</hi> 18.18, 19. <hi>and</hi> 30.11, 15. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22, 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 10. and ſo more cleerly ſtill to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the reſidue of the Prophets. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. <hi>and</hi> 55. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.16, 36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet ſtill more cleerly by <hi>John Baptiſt. Luk.</hi> 1.76, 79. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.9, 10, 11. But ſtill more and moſt fully and cleerly by JESUS CHRIST, and his Apoſtles. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>and</hi> 3.15.17. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.5. which Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt (in reſpect of Chriſt being come and having dyed, and being riſen and aſcended, and filled with ſpirit, and for whom, and to what end, and what he is become for all men, and what to, and for thoſe that beleeve on him,) They have laid the foundation, and other foundation can no man lay, then that which is by them laid. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. And this is done by them alſo, in words of Wiſedome. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4.7. And he that addeth to the words Chriſt hath already revealed by them: God will adde <hi>to him all the Plagues recorded in that Book: and he that taketh away from thoſe words; God will take away his part out of the Book of life.</hi> Revel. 22.18, 19. <hi>And if any man, or Apoſtle, or Angel from heaven, ſhall preach any other Goſpel, then that they have preached, wee are to hold him accurſed.</hi> Gal. 1.8, 9. And what ſhall we then account of this Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Doth not the words of Chriſt and his Apoſtles expreſs their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Or did their words ſerve but for thoſe times, Are they not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary now? have any of us found out fitter words to expreſſe the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:113535:46"/>Goſpel in theſe times, now Chriſt and his Apoſtles are not upon the Earth: <hi>ſhall mortall man be more juſt then God? Shall a man be more pure then his Maker:</hi> Job 4.17. <hi>ſhall any direct the ſpirit of the Lord, and be his Counſellor, to teach Him?</hi> Iſai. 40.13. <hi>Doth he need us? Or ſhall not his Excellency make us afraid?</hi> Job 1 4.9, 11. <hi>Shall any preſume to preſcribe him fitter words for theſe times: and then pull down his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their owne,</hi> and ſay, <hi>What ever his words are, they have not the meaning they ſeem to import:</hi> but their words have: and he meant as they doe; <hi>O yee Heavens, be aſtoniſhed at this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here is not all the evill of this Reaſon; for it doth not onely deny the truth and fitneſſe of the words of the Goſpel, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, to put honour upon man: but it pleadeth for, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth many ungodly and profane men: for when Beleevers plead for their Brethrens—<hi>waiting and praying for the ſpirit of grace, to be more abundantly given them.</hi> Luk. 11.13. Joh. 7.38, 39. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.38. And to deſire <hi>to have ſpirituall and gifted men to Preach the Goſpel.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3, 11. 1 Tim. 3.2. <hi>and to have much Preaching and praying.</hi> 2 Tim. 4.2. Col. 4.2. <hi>and to have good order in our Aſſemblies.</hi> 1 Cor. 14.40. <hi>and frequent Aſſemblies.</hi> Hebr. 10.25. <hi>and brotherly Society.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.17. <hi>and</hi> 4.8, 11. <hi>and patient enduring the reproaches the World caſteth on Chriſt and his Goſpel.</hi> Hebr. 13.13. <hi>and holding forth the</hi> Word <hi>of Life in the midſt of a crooked generation.</hi> Phil. 2.15, 16. <hi>and having all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours in the Church, and among Beleevers, as like thoſe approved in the Apoſtles time, as wee can.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.1, 2. <hi>And alledge the Scripture for all theſe.</hi> Doe not many oppoſe, and put by all theſe things, with this; <hi>You muſt conſider the difference of Times:</hi> Thoſe things were not only good, but neceſſary in the Apoſtles times: But they are not ſo neceſſary in theſe times: And this Reaſon not onely juſtifieth their Plea, but exceeds it in evill; for it ſaith as much even of the words of the Doctrine of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this all, but this Reaſon opens the door to prefer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon, before the Divine Teſtimony of Scripture, and to yeeld rather to Reaſon, then to Faith, and ſo opens the door to all Superſtition: Yea, what Hereſy will not carnall Wiſedome thus bring in, of which <hi>wee are warned to take heed.</hi> Col. 2.8, 18, 23. So that this Reaſon proves nought; Yet that none be wronged, I will ſet down what this Reaſon is, and that to the full, as ſerue have expreſſed it: Who write thus.</p>

                  <p>This is the firſt part of the Reaſon, but it is very weak and frothy; For it is evident to a mean underſtanding; that our Saviour ſpake not in <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.24. of his miſſion to dye, and give himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for men: but of his miſſion for his miniſtration here on earth, which was for the Jews, the Circumciſion. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. which miſſion, with greater enlargedneſſe, at his departure, hee left with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.30. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.18. And yet this reſtraint of his miſſion to the Jewes, not wholly excluſive; for then the woman could not have been commended for her faith, which ſhee ſtill held, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived helpe thereby. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.24, 28. and of the ſame nature was the ſending his Diſciples, and of no farther extent as yet. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. And this could be no Reaſon to darken or ſtraiten the extent of the Death and Ranſome of Chriſt, much leſſe a Reaſon of uſing ſuch generall words, as <hi>All men, Every man, The World,</hi> when they meant but ſome onely: For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Before either this miſſion of the Diſciples by Chriſt, or his ſo ſpeaking to the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> hee was ſaid to be ſent into the World, <hi>That the World through him might be ſaved.</hi> Joh. 3.17. <hi>To be the Saviour of the World.</hi> Joh. 4.42. <hi>To give his fleſh for the life of the World.</hi> Joh. 6.51. <hi>To take away the ſinne of the World, and to enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten every man that commeth into the World.</hi> Jo. 1.9, 29. therefore thoſe things which followed after, could not be the cauſe or occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this manner of ſpeaking, that was ſo long, and oft be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their miſſion was after enlarged, <hi>to goe into all the World, and to preach the Goſpel to every creature.</hi> Mat, 28.20. Mar. 16.15. and ſo then, no neceſſity of uſing words importing more then truth, nor before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. While theſe generall words were frequent in uſe, the ſame is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:113535:47"/>ſtill affirmed of the miniſtration of Chriſt, That it was of (or for the Jewes) the Circumciſion: and that for the good of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and ſo affirmed to them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8, 9. ſo that hitherto, this great Reaſon is reaſonleſſe.</p>
                  <p>As for that, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.6, 7. <hi>Paul</hi> had his Goſpel revealed to him long before that time, and that by Chriſt himſelf, and was ſent to the Gentiles; And hee was kept back from thoſe places, but at that time, becauſe it was not Gods ſeaſon; or he had prepared other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for that People, many of whom ere long received the Goſpel ſweetly. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. So as this gives no cauſe at all, to doubt of the extent of that Ranſome, much leſſe to uſe words inporting more then truth for all places could not be miniſtred to at once: nor are the ſervants to appoint, which firſt, and which after; That belongs to God: So as yet the Reaſon gets no ſtrength; I will therefore adde the refidue of it, to ſee if that will.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, in that they were eye-witneſſes of the Comming, Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, and had the fulneſſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation, and manner of making it, <hi>his glorious power, kingdome, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and comming againe; and ſo his becomming the Saviour of the World; the head and husband of the Church, the Lord and Judge of all, more gloriouſly; evidenced to them, then ever to any before.</hi> Joh. 1.14.

                  <p>And though the Revelation of the performance of the firſt, and the fulneſſe of the ſecond, and the freeneſſe of the third, were all in ſome meaſure hidden, till they began to be ſo performed, and the ſtumble of the beleeving Jewes, was about the third, and all now cleered to the Apoſtles. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.25, 26, 27. yet was this myſtery joyntly in all the three Branches, not altogether hidden, nor now altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther newly revealed: for the Apoſtles ſpake nothing, but what the Prophets did ſay ſhould come to paſſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.22. nothing, but what they had the ſure word of Prophecy for. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20. and ſo the Apoſtle gives us to underſtand, that he meanes not, that it was not at all made knowne, but that it was not ſo made knowne, as it is now. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.5, 6.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the Apoſtles had (with this full and cleer Revelation) the abundance of Spirit given into them. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. and preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, with the holy Ghoſt, ſent down from heaven. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.

                  <p>Wherefore there is no Reaſon to affirm, that without doubt, this mentioned in the latter part of the Reaſon, ſhould be one Reaſon of the frequent mentioning of thoſe generall words; <hi>All men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For on whoſe part ſhould it be a reaſon, for ſuch an end? On the part of the Jewes, in reſpect of themſelves, it could be no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe they reckoned themſelves <hi>the People of God; and ſeed of Abraham,</hi> and for the <hi>Iewes,</hi> in reſpect of the Gentiles: it could be no reaſon, while the Miniſtration of the Goſpel was not ſent to the Gentiles: If any ſay, Yes, to prepare them to receive the Gentiles: Wee ſee it had not that effect, with the beleeving Jewes; who were not with ſuch words prevailed withall, in that wherein they did ſtumble; and yet to the Jewes is the Goſpel of Chriſt, being the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of All men, Every man, the World,</hi> frequently ſet forth before the Commiſſion of the Miniſtration of the Goſpel to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Joh. 1.4.7, 9.29. and 3.16, 17. and 6.51. and 12.46, 47, 48. and 8.13.</p>
                  <p>And on the part of ſuch Gentiles, as were brought in to beleeve, before the mentioning the uſe of ſuch words to them, it could not be a Reaſon, and yet to them alſo is the Goſpel, ſo ſet forth in ſuch generall words. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. <hi>and</hi> 5.12.18. <hi>and</hi> 14.9, 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15, 19. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 5.</p>
                  <p>And even ſo is it ſet forth, both to beleeving Jewes and Gentiles: and that as the Goſpel they had to declare to ſuch as yet beleeved not, whether Jewes or Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

World:</hi> and it is no where ſaid of the death of Chriſt, it was for ſome Jewes, and ſome Gentiles, ſome of all Nations, much leſſe can it be ſaid, onely for the Elect of all Nations; So that this whole Reaſon is proved to be but a meer fancy, purpoſely framed, to colour the unbelief of That, which cannot be denyed, to be plainly teſtifyed in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>And now let the Objection, with the Three Arguments, and this great reaſon, be truly conſidered apart and together, and the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Scripture, according thereto: and this appeares therein.</p>
                  <p>That it endeavours to make the Sentences and words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:113535:50"/>of no force at all; and ſo addes ſtrength to the blaſphemy of thoſe that have ſaid; <hi>That the Scripture is but a dumbe Letter, Incky Divinity; a nooſe of wax, that may be bended every way, according to the will of the Interpreter;</hi> whoſe blaſphemous mouthes, by this meanes opened, will not be ſtopped till the words and ſayings of Scripture be ſtood too, in the ſenſe they expreſſe and import.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the grant of this Objection, and the uſe of ſuch reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by which it is fortified, hath been the opening of the doore, for men to abuſe the Scripture, to the countenanceing of every He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recy, and ſinne, and for the deniall of truth affirmed, and duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is alſo that which hath given the ſtrength to ſome to plead, the Church to give authority to the Scripture, and the need of a Pope to determine the ſenſe: and others of divers Sects, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no truth in any ſentence of Scripture, but according to the Interpretation and judgements of the Maſters of their Sects, and and others to look for vaine and ſantaſticall Revelations, not heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Letter of Scripture, and ſo to faſten on any pleaſing fancy, though without, or againſt the ſayings of Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yea, this is the root and preſerver of all falſities, deviſions and contentions.</p>
                  <p>But that it may appeare, I juſtly charge this Objection, with ſuch uſe of Arguments and Reaſons to fortify the ſame: I will give a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inſtance of ſuch manner eſtimate of, and dealing with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                     <p>And there was great reaſon, why in thoſe times, they ſhould uſe ſuch generall words, as <hi>All Men, Every man,</hi> when they meant but ſome; for was it not ſaid, <hi>Hee ſhewed his words unto Iacob, and his Statutes and Iudgements unto Iſrael; He bath not dealt ſo with any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. That now by theſe generall words; <hi>the Elect among the Gentiles, might be encouraged to feare the Lord, and ſtand in awe of him;</hi> according to that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.8.</p>

               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <p>Is not this ungodly dealing with, and profaning of the Scripture and if the words doe not beare the ſenſe they import, who ſhall tell us what the ſenſe is; and what a gap is here to all wickedneſſe! Yet thoſe generall words, <hi>All men, Every Man,</hi> and <hi>the World,</hi> are not ſo often found in Scripture, in affirmation of any of the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned particulars; As in affirming the <hi>death of Chriſt as the Ranſome;</hi> And ſurely, hee that will not beleeve the ſame, for the teſtimony the Scripture giveth of it: doth not beleeve any of the former for the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Scripture; but for ſome other cauſe that is moveable.</p>
                  <p>If any ſay, what need of Interpreters, if the Scriptures have the ſenſe the words thereof import: I Anſwer, they are very needfull; not to Straighten, or take away the ſenſe the words import; or to deviſe another; But to open and explaine, That ſenſe the words beares, and to cleerand evidence out of the words themſelves, and confirm it by other-like places, and ſo to preſſe it on us; and apply it to us for admonition, Inſtruction, Dehortation, Exhortation, Conſolation, and ſo to root out this evill eſtimate of the Scriptures and evill dealing with it, from the hearts and mouthes of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; that the Scripture may be eſteemed meet to anſwer words of truth with, as is ſaid. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.21.</p>

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. Being ſpoken in the firſt Perſon: and applicatively of perception of love in the <hi>Death of Chriſt:</hi> propounded for example and motive: It is much abuſed, in being cited to this end; as may be ſeen, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. and 4. and 5. and ſo the Propoſition is of no force: for it is a proof of the Love of God to the World, <hi>That hee ſent his Sonne to be the Saviour of the World, Joh.</hi> 3.16. and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. and ſo of the Love of Chriſt to mankind. <hi>To give himſelf a Ranſome for all men.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. and yet a proof of more eſpeciall Love. To chooſe, and bring any in the perception of this Love, to Union and Fellowſhip with himſelf. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.15, 16. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 7. as in our Types, the bringing out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was a proof of his Love to all ſo brought out; but yet more eſpeciall love to thoſe that hearkened to his Judgements, and did them. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.8, 12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the Apoſtles doe not there propound the Death of Chriſt, to ſhew how many he dyed for; or as the foundation, to bring in unbelievers to beleeve, or to ſhew how many God loves; but onely ſpeaking of the perception of Love by Beleevers: He ſheweth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:113535:52"/>they perceived it; and that was, <hi>in that he laid down his life for us.</hi> (and this was ſure, when wee were his enemies, and ſo found when he called us alſo. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.2, 4. And that to this end, to move us even ſo to love our Brother (who without queſtion is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,) whereas this Objection ſhuts the door of <hi>loving any,</hi> till, or farther then we know his Election, Though the Goſpel (this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction oppoſeth) giveth a certaine ground, <hi>for loving all men with Love of Compaſſion.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. Tit. 3.2, 3, 4. and for <hi>Loving Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers with Love of delight.</hi> Pſalm. 16.2. Coloſs. 1.4, 5. Phil. 1.3, 4, 5, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>This Aſſumption is full of infidelity and Blaſphemy; If it had been, <hi>that God doth not love every man in the World:</hi> It might have been granted and proved; But to ſay, <hi>God hath not loved any but his Church, and choſen, whom he loves to the end;</hi> is a blaſphemy ſo great, that the ſame may be ſaid of it, which is ſpoken of that Apoſtacy, <hi>Jere.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. For this, with one breath, both blaſphemeth, and contradicteth our Saviours affirmation of <hi>Gods love of the World,</hi> ſome part whereof will notwithſtanding periſh. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>The Prophets affirmation, <hi>That the Lord is good to All; and his tender mercies are over all his Workes.</hi> Pſalm. 145.8, 9. <hi>and</hi> 136.25.</p>
                  <p>Yea, the truth and force of all Gods earneſt Expoſtulation, Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Love, Exhortations, and Call to ſuch as refuſed. <hi>Deutr.</hi> 5.29. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 5. <hi>and</hi> 7.1. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23, 24. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.19.</p>
                  <p>Yea, the truth and force of our Saviours Exhortation to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, for <hi>being like their heavenly Father, in Love and mercy to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> Matth. 5.44.48.</p>
                  <p>The Teſtimony of Gods goodneſſe in all his Works. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.</p>
                  <p>Yea, this Aſſumption goeth yet further, in that it doth not onely ſay, <hi>God doth not now love them,</hi> (while they walk in ſin) <hi>But God hath not loved every man in the World; no, not any time ſince</hi> Adams <hi>fall. So as to give any Ranſome for them;</hi> and ſo denyeth. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                  <p>Nay, it ſtops not here, <hi>(except his Elect, whom he loves for ever;)</hi> It ſaith, <hi>Hee hath not loved any other of mankind; no, not when he made and beheld them all righteous in</hi> Adam, <hi>as the Publick Perſon; and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, and avouched all his workes good.</hi> Eccl. 7.29. Gen. 1.27, 31.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:113535:52"/>It ſaith, <hi>God hath not loved, but hated them:</hi> (oh fearfull! To ſay, <hi>that God hateth the Righteous,</hi> Pſal. 45.7.) <hi>and ſo they could not fall from the love of God, in the fall of</hi> Adam; <hi>ſince his Love was never to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: nor could they fall under the hatred of God, by ſinne, either Originall or Actuall, ſince they were under it before,</hi> (if this Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were true;) for it ſaith, <hi>hee hath not loved them:</hi> and if any ſhould tell them, <hi>Their ſinnes are very great, for offending ſo loving a God; for deſpiſing ſo rich a Ranſome, and refuſing the grace offered them in the meanes; and giving way to ſerve ſinne, that coſt Chriſt Jeſus his blood, to ſatisfie for them; And that they forſake their owne mercies, by following lying vanities:</hi> And ſo warne them of the great condemnation that will befall them for the ſame, if they periſh in their evills, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them, by all the Mercies of God, and ſufferings of Chriſt for them; To hearken to the Goſpel, <hi>Repent, and beleeve, and turne unto Chriſt.</hi> This aſſumption holds them back, and ſaith, It is all Lyes; <hi>for God hath not loved them:</hi> Oh whether will this blaſphemy reach!</p>
                  <p>But to give ſome ſatisfying Anſwer to this Objection; Let the Scripture be viewed, what it ſaith of Love, or Hatred, which there appeares two-fold. Firſt the Scripture mentions a divers kind or degree of Love in God towards men, ſhewne in the fruits thereof: as to ſay;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Love of Compaſſion, Pitty and Mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.25. and 145.8, 9. Such a Love, as extendeth it ſelf ſo farre for the good of man, (loved) in good things afforded, That a man is made <hi>ſaveable;</hi> and ſo much is done for him, and to him; That in accepting, and holding the ſame; and yeelding thereto, and therethrough, to God: <hi>Hee might be ſaved,</hi> Pſal. 36.5, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>And leſſe love then this, was not to the Angels, before they fell. <hi>Jude</hi> 6. Nor leſſe love to all Mankind, before they fall. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.29. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. Yea, it was not taken away from Mankind, upon the fall: though the fall deſerved it. <hi>Gene.</hi> 3.15. but in this Love, <hi>Did God give his Sonne to be the Saviour of the Worid.</hi> Iſa. 4.14. Joh. 3.16. And in this Love doth GOD, for his Sonnes ſake, <hi>who gave himſelf a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for all men,</hi> preſerve them. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 20. and therein giveth a witneſſe of his Mercy. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.17. and that to lead them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A love of delight and pleaſance, taking in the <hi>beloved,</hi> an aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:113535:53"/>flowing, and honouring Love, that reſteth not till the Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved be brought into Union, Fellowſhip, and Poſſeſſion of it ſelf, and all its own Priviledges. <hi>Num.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.19. and 36.8. And in this Love doth God love his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Pro. 8.30. Iſa. 42. 1 Jo. 5.20. &amp; 16.15. And in this Love doth Jeſus Chriſt Love all his Elect and choſen Children. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.4. and 147.11. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.9. and 17.21, 23. yet ſo, as this peculiar love, is not manifeſted to them, till in ſight and belief of the former Love, their hearts be overcome to beleeve in JESUS CHRIST, and to love <hi>Him, and their Brethren, and to walk in that love.</hi> 1 Joh. 4.14, 16, 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21, 23.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Scripture mentions a divers kind or degree of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, both in God and man; Shewn in the fruits, as to ſay;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A not ſo much loving, as others are beloved: and this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Hatred.</hi> Geneſ. 29.30.31.33. and ſo intimated, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. and thus it is ſaid of God; <hi>Hee refuſed the Tabernacle of Joſeph, and choſe not the Tribe of</hi> Ephraim. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.67. and ſo he is ſaid <hi>to abhorre Iſrael.</hi> verſ. 59. <hi>and to have been an Enemy to Iſrael.</hi> Lam. 2.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An <hi>Hatred</hi> that is <hi>furious,</hi> poſitive, tending to, and moving for the overthrow and deſtruction of the hated. <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.76.</p>
                  <p>Now the love of <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> and the <hi>Hatred,</hi> that is in a leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Love, may very well ſtand together, both in God. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.5.8, 9. and <hi>in man,</hi> Jere. 9.1, 2. and ſo God may Love, with the Love of Compaſſion, and <hi>ſhew tender mercies, waiting with long ſuffering and patience for, and towards ſuch as he hides himſelf from: and is angry with; and ſpeakes in words and workes againſt.</hi> Iſai. 57.17, 18. and 63.10, 11. Jere. 18.7. Iſa. 31.2.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch kind of Love are his People commanded to follow, and be like him in, even towards ſuch, as for whom they cannot but mourne, and with whom they cannot have intimate Union and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, with Gods allowance, who yet bids them <hi>love them.</hi> Prov. 14.7. and 23.20. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44.48.</p>
                  <p>And to ſay, whoſoever God Loves with this <hi>Love of Compaſſion, hee loves for ever,</hi> or to ſay he hateth with any other hatred, then that which may be in that leſſer <hi>degree of Love,</hi> any, <hi>before they have hardned their hearts againſt him, and turned from him, in abuſing of, and rebelling againſt the fruits of his Love vouchſafed, is plainly contrary
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:113535:53"/>to the Scripture.</hi> Hoſ. 9.10. <hi>I found Iſrael like grapes, &amp;c.</hi> to verſ. 15. <hi>All their wickedneſſe is in</hi> Gilgall <hi>for there I hated them for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe of their doings, I will drive them out of my Houſe; I will love them no more;</hi> So <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.11.13. <hi>and</hi> 1.18, 28. <hi>and</hi> 2.4, 5.</p>
                  <p>And that this Love to mankind may not be undervallewed: This I adde, <hi>that the diſcovery of this love of God to mankind, (in the gift of, and Propitiation made by his Sonne, and fruits thereof,) is, That in and by which the Holy Spirit doth, (uſually) firſt overcome a man, convince him, and enable him to beleeve; and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>renew, and bring him in to God.</hi> Pſal. 36.5, 6, 7. and 107.1.8.15. So Chriſt ſet the ſame before <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> to that end. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5.15.20. and <hi>Paul</hi> the ſame to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19, 20, 21. and confeſſeth himſelf, and the reſt of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, to be ſo brought in to God. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5. And thoſe that have experimented this, can ſet forth the ſame Hope for others, that are in no worſe caſe, then themſelves once were. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14, 16. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>And as for the love of delight, that is peculiar, and appeares not uſually to any, till in beliefe of the former, they be brought to love God, and therefore, even ſo to be waited for. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21.23. and ſo intimated toward Brethren. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.1, 2.</p>
                  <p>But now for ſuch, as while the love of Gods Compaſſion flowes towards them, in his uſe of meanes to them, and moving his People with Compaſſion to endeavour to doe them good, and by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit knocks at their hearts; If ſome of theſe doe, and will perſiſt in rebellion, till he give them up to Satan; ſuch are Reprobated of God, and ſo hated of him; yea, and ſo farre as they are known to be ſuch, they are ſo accounted, and hated of his People; And none but ſuch ſet forth in Scripture to be ſo hated of God. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23.33. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. <hi>Iere.</hi> 6.16.27, 30. 1 Joh. 5.18. which overthrowes the Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Objection.</p>
                  <p>As for the inſtances, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13. although for the Elder to ſerve the younger, be hated, in reſpect of peculiar love (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.67.) yet it ſtands well enough with the love of <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> and as for any other hatred of <hi>Eſau,</hi> the Scripture mentions none, untill it was for the contempt of his <hi>Birth-right,</hi> Heb. 12.17. like that <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.14, 15. which is uſed to warne us, that wee ſlight not the Grace of Chriſt: As for the <hi>Hatred</hi> mentioned. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13. If laying his Mountaines waſte,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:113535:54"/>(which was the fruit of it) did witneſſe ſuch hatred. Did not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giving him thoſe Mountaines, Teſtify like love, though not ſuch as to <hi>Iacob?</hi> Mal. 1.2, 3.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.25. It ſpeakes of the peculiar love of Chriſt to his Church, and ſo of higher ends of giving himſelf, then Ranſom and Propitiation which the Church hath received, even of the ſpeciall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fruits of Spirituall Application, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. Nor is this here ſet forth as a Propoſition for faith; But for an example, for beleeving Husbands and Wives to follow in love, and if he had been exhorting to love of Compaſſion and patience, towards the unjuſt and enemies: Hee would have ſaid, who ſuffered, the juſt, for the unjuſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. So that here he was not ſhewing how <hi>many</hi> God loves, and Chriſt <hi>Dred for,</hi> which other Places ſhewn to be <hi>All men,</hi> of which before, Chap. 4.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.1. will any argue hence, <hi>That becauſe our Saviour lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Apoſtles and his Diſciples;</hi> that by the heavenly Call, were drawne in to him, and followed him in this World, and that as hee having loved them, ſo he loved them to the end; and ſhewed it in his care of them, miniſtration to them, and Prayers for them: for of thoſe, and ſuch love, it is evident he meanes, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.14. and 15. &amp; 16. and 17. Therefore he neither did, nor doth love any, <hi>but his Called ones:</hi> and ſo all muſt firſt love him, before they be at all loved of him: (which is contrary to 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.10, 19.) The Citation of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.1. to this Aſſumption, implyeth ſo much: but falſly, for it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; That <hi>Judas Iſcariot</hi> was none of thoſe that were Adverſaries to Jeſus Chriſt, for his Love, and rewarded him <hi>evill for good, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred for his Love.</hi> Pſal. 109.4, 5.

                  <p>Firſt, in the Propoſition, are two notorious untruth's; as to ſay, 1. <hi>That all, that Chriſt did Die, and pay the price and Ranſome for, which GOD required to ſatisfie his</hi> Juſtice, <hi>are juſtified by His Blood.</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7.</p>
                  <p>This is ſo contradictory to the Scripture, that little need be ſaid thereof; enough is already ſhewn in the 8. Chap. from the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon between Chriſt and <hi>Adam,</hi> and how that all men fell, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came under ſinne and death in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> at once; Yet none by, or through him partake of that miſery in ſinfulneſſe and death, Till they come to have a beeing from him: And ſo, though all men be in Chriſt, as the Publick Perſon, reſtored and juſtified: yet by and through him, of the benefit of that reſtauration, in juſtification by his blood; Doe none partake, till they come to have a beeing in him; and that which is Naturall, is firſt, as is there ſhewn.</p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:113535:55"/>
                  <p>Beſides, what ever juſtification be in Chriſt, (through his blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed) for men, yet he is ſet forth to be a Propitiation, through faith in his blood, for the Remiſſion of Sinnes. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. And it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; that the Juſtification by his blood, mentioned. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. Is a juſtification received by faith in his blood: of ſuch as have received the Atonement in beleeving: as is evident, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.3.11. neither is it any where ſaid, <hi>by the Spirit of God;</hi> nor did hee ever teach any to ſay; <hi>That all that Chriſt Dyed, and gave himſelf a Ranſome for; either ſo are, or ſhall be juſtifyed by his blood;</hi> Hee ever affirmes, <hi>that Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be by blood, but not by blood-ſhed onely,</hi> but by and in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the <hi>blood-ſhed, the ſprinkling or waſhing therewith.</hi> Heb. 12.24. 1 Pet. 1.2. And ſo have the juſtified ones confeſſed. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.5. and this is to be redeemed unto God, <hi>and juſtified by his blood.</hi> Revel. 5.9. of which Juſtification by his blood, many that have it, had their time here on this Earth, in which they wanted it. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Elect (in Gods Counſell,) that yet want it, for whom by this Objection, Chriſt ſhould not have Dyed.</p>
                  <p>As for that <hi>cleanſing.</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. and <hi>forgiveneſſe,</hi> verſ. 9. it ſpeakes of a farther <hi>cleanſing</hi> and <hi>diſpenſation of grace</hi> to ſuch as are in Chriſt, and walke in Chriſt, and ſo already juſtifyed <hi>by his blood;</hi> and ſo not to this purpoſe, unleſſe to make the Objection vile.</p>
                  <p>But this untruth is not onely falſe and groſſe in it ſelf; but oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and denyeth many ſayings of the Truth; for it denies the truth of our Saviours ſayings. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>and</hi> 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſſes and ſinnes;</hi> and ſo walke, <hi>till they be borne againe. Epheſ.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. <hi>That God ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyeth the ungodly in their comming in to beleeve on him.</hi> Rom. 4.5. Yea this untruth denyeth, <hi>that men are juſtifyed by faith,</hi> ſo much, as by an Inſtrument receiving it, but onely diſcerning it: Seeing this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untruth affirmeth them juſtified (not onely in, but) by <hi>his Blood;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to beleeve on him: and ſo contradicts. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. and 13.38. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26, 28. and 4.24, 25. and 5.1.11. So that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this affirmation is true, namely;</p>
                  <p>That many, for whom JESUS CHRIST did Die, and ſhed his blood, remaine yet without that Juſtification that is in him, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:113535:55"/>of his <hi>blood-ſhed</hi> for them; and ſo are not juſtified by his blood, becauſe they beleeve nor on him. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.38. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That all that Chriſt did die, and pay the price and Ranſome for, which God required to ſatisfie his Juſtice; ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him.</p>
                  <p>This likewiſe is very falſe, and plainly contradictory to the Scripture, that ſaith in expreſſe termes, <hi>there will be many, even deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.1, 2. And this untruth denieth the Lordſhip of Chriſt, grounded on his death <hi>for All;</hi> and the equity of his Judgement, and ſentence of any to a ſecond death. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9.12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 11. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30.31. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10, 14, 15. as is ſhewn Chap. 2. before; And this untruth denyeth that aggravation of ſinne which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uſeth, when it chargeth with ſuch an evill, as cauſing to periſh <hi>the weake Brother, for whom Chriſt Dyed.</hi> Rom. 14.15. 1 Cor. 8.11. So that the contrary to this Affirmation is true, <hi>That many for whom Chriſt dyed, and gave himſelf a Ranſome, that he might be their Lord, and they live to him, ſhall one day be overthrowne in wrath, or fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable, becauſe they would not ſubmit to him, nor ſuffer him to Reigne over them.</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.8.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the Reaſon annext to the Propoſition, is both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous raſhneſſe, and groſs ignorance declared; as to ſay:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A preſumptuous raſhneſſe, in an intimate charging God with unjuſtice, for did not God lay on Chriſt the iniquity of us all. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.2, 6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. was not Chriſt manifeſted, to <hi>take away our ſinnes,</hi> and is He not without ſinne, <hi>even the juſt One.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.5. and 2.1, 2. and hath not God accepted him and his <hi>Sacrifice and Ranſome given.</hi> Matth. 17, 5. Heb. 7.8, 9, 10. even for all that for which hee gave it; and is not God Righteous, to give his Sonne, even all that which by vertue of his Ranſome onely, belonged to Jeſus Chriſt: Surely God is Righteous; but that were injuſtice, not onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the whole Debt againe, but even any part thereof, either of him, or of any other, that are diſcharged by him, or to detaine from him, or any of his, any thing that by vertue of that Ranſome onely, is due to be conferred on them: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11.</p>
                  <p>Yet Gods owne Children have complained, and cryed out by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:113535:56"/>of trouble, with <hi>the law of ſinne in their members. Rom.</hi> 7.15.24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. and God ſaith of his owne Children, that are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.32. <hi>I will viſite their tranſgreſſions with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes;</hi> and ſaith expreſly, <hi>They ſuffer for the puniſhment of their ſinne.</hi> Lam. 3.22, 39. and in their Repentance, will have them accept the puniſhment of their iniquity. <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.41. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.9.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſay, the puniſhments upon Gods Children, are not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for ſinne, but onely corrections for amendment (they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both) is too weak an evaſion, and contradictory to the Scripture. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. and 6.1, 2. and 12.1. <hi>Now is God unrighteous, that puniſheth, God forbid.</hi> Rom. 3.4, 5. Pſal. 51.4. But how will the urgers of this Reaſon, for juſtifying the two Propoſitions; juſtify God; and get out of this ſnare they have laid for others. I hope they will not ſay with the
<note n="*" place="margin">See the Poſtſcript</note> 
                     <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt onely paid the greateſt part of the debt to his Father, wholly in reſpect of eternall puniſhments, and left a part of the debt in reſpect of Temporall puniſhments, for his people to pay, in bearing the ſame here in ſufferings and Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall Satisfactions; and making up what is wanting thereof in <hi>Purgatory:</hi> for this will exceedingly derogate from the Sufferings and Satisfaction made by Chriſt, to his Father; and flying this, as they have good cauſe to doe; they have, by joyning this Reaſon with the two former Propoſitions, charged God with unjuſtice; and left no way to juſtify him, in puniſhing any of his Elect, for <hi>whom Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and paid the price,</hi> they being already juſtifyed, and to be ſaved from wrath through him, as the Propoſition affirmeth; and what preſumptuous raſhneſſe was this ſo to Reaſon and affirme, for the maintenance of two falſhods. Neither doth <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. ſay, <hi>That all that Chriſt dyed, and paid the price for, ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſpeaking of Beleevers that had experimented juſtification through his blood: and it declares the more abundance of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; That they ſhould now much rather be ſaved by his life, <hi>and from wrath through him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here appeareth groſs ignorance, about the End of the Death of Chriſt, as the price, <hi>Satisfaction for ſinne, and Ranſome, which hee
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:113535:56"/>gave himſelf to God, for mankind:</hi> which was not, that by that Act of his with God, men ſhould, without any more done by him,

Tit. 3.4.5, 7. <hi>or Redemption of their bodies in a through and perfect Freedome from all miſery and Death, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſorrow of Soul, mortallity, weakneſſe, affliction and Death of body, which is to be affected at his pleaſure through his Divine Power, by vertue of his reſurrection from the Dead.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>tot.</hi> or the bringing them to, and poſſeſſing them of all the life, Righteouſneſſe and Inheritance that he hath obtained: which is to be effected through the vertue of his blood, by his life, Spirit and <hi>Divine Power.</hi> Rom. 5.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. Heb. 7.25.</p>
                  <p>But the End of His Death, in reſpect of the Ranſome only, as perfected in and by himſelf, in his owne body, was; That <hi>he might be Lord of all men, and have them in his diſpoſe;</hi> That hee might have all releaſed to him, and have the pardon in his hands, and Spirit and Life, and inheritance to give freely, as hee ſhould thinke fit, who <hi>is of one minde with his Father; That hee might have Power and Authority to eaſe them of as much trouble, exerciſe as much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and ſhew them as much mercy and bounty, as might be meet to lead them to Repentance; And alſo to uſe ſuch meanes as hee pleaſeth, to Call and bring them to Repentance, and Faith, and to ſend forth his Spirit to move at their Hearts, that they might Repent and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That by Spirituall Application of his Blood; and exerciſe of his <hi>Divine Power;</hi> hee might juſtifie, purifie, and bring to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, thoſe that in ſubmiſſion to his Spirit, in the meanes, doe Repent and come in to beleeve on him,—To harden, and give up the reſt in his Seaſon,—To raiſe all out of their graves at the laſt; and to bring all before his Judgement-ſeat, and then to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:113535:57"/>poſſeſſe of the Inheritance all that in the day of grace have beleeved on him, and to ſentence to a ſecond death, all that throughout the day of grace have rebelled againſt him, and for thoſe ends hee gave the ranſome, and paid the whole debt himſelf alone, and without requiring it againe, or any part of it of Chriſt, or any other; God hath given all this over into the hands of Chriſt, and will not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth deprive him of any part, nor any other of any part, of that which by the diſpenſation of Chriſt, appertaines to them; And all this is already ſhewn in Chap. 1. in the Reconciliation wrought by Chriſt with God for men, and the common Salvation extended to men; and in Chap. 2. in the firſt end of the death of Chriſt, in the three reſpects thereof, and in Chap. 3. the ſecond head therof, and in the latter end of the 6. Chapter, in ſtating the Queſtion, and in Chap. 9.</p>
                  <p>Now then, that any mercy in patience and bounty is vouchſafed to men; that any means is uſed, and any motion of Spirit afforded, is the fruit of the Ranſome of Chriſt, to lead to Repentance: That any miſery yet, that lies on them, it is from the Wiſedome and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Chriſt, whoſe ſeaſon is not yet come to free them. But that which holdeth any under finne and wrath, and condemnation, and deprives them of the benefit of the Death and Ranſome of Chriſt, is their unbelief: Not ſimply, becauſe they were ſinners, but becauſe by Repentance and faith they come not in to him that hath made <hi>Satisfaction for their ſinnes.</hi> Joh. 3.18.36. and 8.12. and this is Juſt, and according to Gods mind. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p>And ſo to Anſwer the Objection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All men were bound by vertue of the grace of God in the Creation, to Love God with all their heart, minde, ſoule, and ſtrength, and their Neighbours as themſelves; and to walke in that love; and the leaſt varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſhort comming thereof, leaves them under ſinne, curſe and death, and helpleſſe; they having no power to fulfill this Law, having loſt it in the fall, and ſo hopeleſſe. And by vertue of the grace of God in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption wrought by Chriſt, all men are againe farther bound to this former love, and walking in it; and ſhort-comming thereof, leaves them alſo under ſinne, curſe and death.</hi> Gal. 3.10. <hi>And power thereto they yet have none, yet notwithout hope, in that the Propitiation is made by him for them.</hi> Joh. 1.29. 1 Joh. 2.2. <hi>and hee it filled with Spirit, to ſend
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:113535:57"/>forth to them, and will enlighten every of them.</hi> Pſal. 68.18. <hi>By vertue of that common Salvation extended to all men by Chriſt, the doore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith is opened, and they in the meanes, and in ſome ſort, by Spirit at one time or other, called to Repentance, and howſoever God ſeems to winck it their follies till then; yet then hee warneth them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that ſo repenting, and comming in to beleeve in Chriſt, they may through him receive remiſſion of ſinnes, and be enabled to love God in Chriſt, and one another, as Chriſt hath loved them; and to walke in that Faith and Love.</hi> Act. 14.17. <hi>and</hi> 17.30, 31. <hi>and for want of this, they remaine under ſinne and wrath, and in danger of a Second Death.</hi> Joh. 3.17, 18, 19. and this is a new Debt.</p>
                  <p>Now if Jeſus Chriſt ſend forth more light and meanes, and ſtrive farther with them, and they be found hardning themſelves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt him; It increaſeth ſtill their debt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. And if he viſite with puniſhments, he is juſt and Righteous, and there is mercy alſo in it. <hi>Joh.</hi> 33.14.23.</p>
                  <p>And if hee ſtill ſtrive, and they ſtill refuſe both inſtruction and correction, and will not ſubmit and come in to their lawfull Lord, that bought them, and called them: if hee give them up to Sathan and deſtruction; Is not this juſt? <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Jere.</hi> 6.16.28, 30. And thus wee find in Scripture, ſet forth; That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All ſmarting corrections on Beleevers, are for ſinne againſt Grace, Goodneſſe and Spirit, in the means vouchſafed.</hi> Levit. 26.11.14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All heavy judgements on others, for impriſoning the knowne truth in unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> Rom. 1.16, 17. <hi>and refuſing to be gathered by Chriſt.</hi> Mat. 23.37. <hi>the great condemning evills are ſet downe.</hi> Heb. 6.4, 5. <hi>and</hi> 10.29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By our Saviours Affirmation.</hi> Joh. 3.18, 19. <hi>and the Spirits convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Joh. 16 8, 11.</p>
                  <p>Unbelief is the main ſinne, and the cauſe why ſo many abide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of ſinne, and the cauſe that ſinne hath ſuch Power, and brings forth ſo many evill fruits in men; and it is the root and nurſe of more grievous ſinnes that they fall into; and all may be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in one word. <hi>Not obeying the Goſpel of God:</hi> and this is the debt which God requires; and for which men ſhall ſuffer in everlaſting fire. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8.</p>
                  <p>So that here is not two payments of one debt, but a new debt, in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:113535:58"/>ſpiſing the Goodneſſe of GOD, in the Remedy provided, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>old Debt,</hi> in a new manner of guiltineſſe, for deſpiſing the Remedy; not ſeeking, nor accepting the Releaſe procured by Chriſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40.</p>
                  <p>And here is another, even a Second death, when all are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of the firſt,) even that which was not primely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for mankind, but for the Devill and his Angells. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41.</p>
                  <p>And it is juſtice with God, to give over all into the hands of his Sonne, who <hi>will judge them All, according to the Goſpel,</hi> in which he was ſet forth to them; <hi>and they would not that he ſhould Reign over them.</hi> Joh. 12.48. Rom. 2.16. Luke 19.14, 22, 27. And is not God and Chriſt juſt in all this?</p>
                  <p>Surely, among men this would be underſtood; If ſome Subjects had committed Treaſon againſt their King, and offered indignity to his Crowne, and had waſted his treaſure, and were for this baniſhed from the Court, deprived of their Eſtates, confined to darke Priſon among ſlaves; and enjoyned to ſuffer ſtripes every day; and at a certaine time, to ſuffer a ſhamefull and tormenting death: If the Kings ſoul longed to ſhew them mercy, and his Juſtice not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting; and the Kings Sonne, with his Fathers conſent, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for theſe Traitors, to bring them before the King againe: and ſhould for them lay downe his Crowne, ſuffer the puniſhment due to them; and give a ſufficient Ranſome to the King for them all: that hee may have the Pardon for them all; and have them all releaſed to him, that Hee may bee their Lord, and bring them out of Priſon at his Pleaſure, and beſtow the Inheritance on as many of them as would accept his grace, and willingly come under his Government, and judge the reſt: And that hee might have Liberty to eaſe them of ſo much of their daily paines in the Priſon, and ſhew them what favours, and uſe what meanes hee pleaſed to perſwade and allure them to come under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: And the King profeſſes himſelfe to bee fully ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Sonnes Ranſome, and ſetts him on his Throne, and gives all this into his hands, and ſends word of this new Treaty to the Impriſoned Traytors, and bids them to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſubmit to his Sonne: And the Kings Sonne begins to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:113535:58"/>take Order for them; ſo that the greateſt of their daily Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Paines is taken away, many ſweet refreſhings and Liberties afforded them in the Priſon, to winne them to good eſtimate of the Prince, who ſends his Ambaſſadours amongſt them with the Proclamation of the Pardon, and invitation to come in to the Government of the Prince, and Promiſe, that whoſoever ſo did, ſhould both have the Pardon given him, and be made an Heire with the Prince: If any of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre their Fellowſhip with the Slaves, and Liberties given them in Priſon, before theſe offers of the Prince, and refuſe to come under his gracious Government, And then at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, hee call them all out of Priſon, and adjudge them a Double Puniſhment, and a more grievous death then that he delivered them from; and aggravate their Rebellions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; By all the Evills they were found in when hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook for them, and all the coſt hee was at for them; and all the meanes hee uſed towards them, and all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of their Rebellion againſt him: and ſo judge them to Puniſhment accordingly; Will any reaſonable man ſay now; That this were injuſtice now in the King, or the Kings Sonne, or two payments of one debt; I am perſwaded not; Though no comparriſon can fully ſet forth, but darkly hint this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; And enough to Anſwer the Objection, which was directly framed to gain-ſay the expreſſe and plaine Sayings of Scripture.</p>

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>This Objection is very falſe, and many wayes faulty; For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It were neither right nor good reaſoning, to ſay, God would never make the Heavens and the Earth, and a World of Creatures in both, for that man; and make that <hi>man in His own Image,</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and put him in a Paradiſe, and give him a <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> and provide him a <hi>Sabboath,</hi> and make him <hi>Lord of the Workes of his hands;</hi> and put the Life and Priviledges of all Mankind in his keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whom he would not preſerve in that good eſtate; yet hath this Argument the ſame (though in a leſſe degree of) ſtrength, to deny <hi>God's creating all men;</hi> yea, or <hi>the firſt</hi> Adam <hi>righteous:</hi> That this Objection hath, to denie <hi>the Death of Chriſt as a Ranſome for All.</hi> Eccl. 7.29. 1 Pet. 4.19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Objection expreſſeth not what manifeſtation it meaneth, and this is ſure; Chriſt will ſo <hi>manifeſt himſelf to All men,</hi> that they ſhall ſee what right of Lordſhip he had over them, by vertue of his <hi>Death and Ranſome given,</hi> and Conqueſt made for them; Even ſo, that they ſhall ſee the greatneſſe of their ſinne, in deſpiſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt Him, and Perſecuting His; and ſhall come before his
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:113535:59"/>Judgement-ſeat, and acknowledge him Lord, to the glory of God. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.23. <hi>and</hi> 66.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 35.11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.19.12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10, 11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If Jeſus Chriſt had any where ſaid; That hee never did, nor ever would pray for the World (which he never ſaid,) yet it were evill in us, to uſe that as a Reaſon to denie the truth of his owne words; That ſaid, he would give his <hi>fleſh for the life of the World.</hi> Joh. 6.51. <hi>and that he dyed for all.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. <hi>and every man. Heb.</hi> 2.9. <hi>and gave himſelf a Ranſome for All.</hi> 1 Tim. 2.6.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Argument confounds into one, without difference or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Gods love of Compaſſion,</hi> (which belongs to all. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.8, 9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16.) and his <hi>love of Delight,</hi> (which only belongs to all thoſe which in beliefe of his former Love, are brought in to love him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Death of Chriſt, <hi>as the Propitiation and Ranſome,</hi> (which is <hi>for All.</hi> Heb. 2.9. 1 Tim. 2.6. 1 Joh. 2.2.) and the adva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Chriſt, (that is onely,) for Beleevers. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſt ſending his Spirit, <hi>to enlighten every man.</hi> Joh. 1.9. and 16.8, 11. and his Peculiar giving of Spirit, <hi>to comfort and lead Beleevers into all Truth.</hi> Joh. 14.17. and 16.14, 15. All which things the Scripture maketh diſtinct, as is ſhewne. Chap. 1. and 2. and 3. and 10.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thoſe to whom Chriſt doth graciouſly manifeſt himſelf, are in his firſt manifeſting himſelf to them, found ſinners, and ungodly, and <hi>of the World,</hi> as they were when he Dyed for them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.5. <hi>and</hi> 65. 1 <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.3, 4, 5. <hi>and</hi> 26.13, 18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.16. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>So that this whole Argument is fallen without farther Anſwer; yet the Proofs are to be conſidered, to ſee whether they counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it, or be abuſed by it;</p>
                  <p>To prove the firſt Propoſition is cited. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>Hee that ſpared not his owne Sonne, but delivered him up for us all: how ſhall be not with him, freely give us all things alſo.</hi>
                  </p>

               <div n="1" type="answer">
                  <head>ANSWER. I.</head>
                  <p>This is not ſpoken in the third Perſon, nor of the Ranſome one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:113535:60"/>nor as a Propoſition for unbeleevers to bring them in to beleeve, and ſo gives not Anſwer to the Queſtion, <hi>for how many be dyed?</hi> and ſo is dangerouſly abuſed, in being brought to that end, as is ſhewne, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.4. This being applicatively ſpoken, of and to Beleevers, to confirme them in that abundant hope which they had, and which no other had or could have, till they beleeved, and ſo were in Chriſt, as they were. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10.13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is not ſpoken ſo, as may ſerve the Propoſition, <hi>viz. Hee that ſpared not his owne Sonne, but delivered him up for us all; how ſhall Hee not freely give us all things;</hi> It is not ſaid ſo: <hi>But how ſhall hee not with him alſo freely give us all things:</hi> So ſpeaking of his <hi>free giving him to us, and with him all things alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee that beleeve, doe through the grace and mercy of God, in ſome meaſure know, that Jeſus Chriſt, having made the Propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in being delivered up <hi>to death for our ſinnes; and raiſed for our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</hi> Rom. 4.25. Is now exalted at <hi>Gods right hand: unmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably filled with the Holy Ghoſt, in our nature glorified, The Advocate, high Prieſt, Prophet and King.</hi> Act. 2.32.33. 1 Joh. 2.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7, 8. <hi>The Wiſedome of God: the Power of God: the Sonne of God, and Heire of the Kingdome.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24. Matth. 13.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. <hi>The brightneſſe of his glory, and the expreſſe Image of his Perſon, by whom hee uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, and that is one with the Father, and in whom the Father dwells.</hi> Heb. 1.3. Joh. 10.30. and 14.9, 10, 11, 20. whoſe all that is the Fathers, is, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Who is made of God, to us, wiſedome, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, Sanctification and Redemption.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>Who is the Fountaine of Life and ſpirit, out of whom it aboundantly floweth to all that beleeve on him, and walke in that ſaith, to make them Sonnes, to witneſſe their Sonſhip, to confirme them to Chriſt, To lead them into all Truth, to preſerve them, to cauſe all to worke for good to them; to bring them to the Inheritanc and Kingdome with himſelf.</hi> Pſal. 36.8, 9. Act. 2.33. Joh. 7.38, 39. Tit. 3.4.7. Joh. 1.12. Rom. 8.16. 2 Cor. 3.3.18. Joh. 16.13, 14. Rom. 8.28.17. 1 Pet. 1.3.5.</p>
                  <p>Now when God, by his Spirit, ſo makes known his grace in Chriſt, through the Goſpel, that he enters the heart, with the grace of Chriſt enabling it to beleeve, and ſo receive the Attonement, That the Beleever is enabled thereby to depend on Chriſt for the hope Diſcovered in him; Then and therein is the Beleever drawne, and given to Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.44, 45. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21, 22. and Chriſt in and by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:113535:60"/>his Word and Spirit, is given to the Beleever. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6. So as the Beleevers may ſay, <hi>Not onely unto us a Sonne is borne;</hi> but alſo, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us a Sonne is given.</hi> Iſai. 9.6.</p>
                  <p>They now by free-gift, and by beleeving receit, having Chriſt, and having life by having him, and being Sonnes alſo thereby. 1 Joh. 5.10, 11, 12, 13. Joh. 1.12, 13. which giveth them hope of all good. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.1, 2.</p>
                  <p>And hence the Apoſtle raiſeth the Concluſion of faith, hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now given us freely this his owne Sonne, whom before, when we were enemies, hee delivered up to death for us, <hi>How ſhall hee not now</hi> (in giving him,) <hi>with him alſo freely give us all things.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.24, 25.5.1.5.10, 11. and 1 Cor. 3.22, 23. Gal. 3.29. with this. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. and all this will well appeare.</p>
                  <p>So that this Place gives no Proof to the Propoſition; and is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly abuſed, to be cited to beare ſuch a ſenſe, as ſhuts the doore againſt all the choice uſes of it, and opens a doore to horrible abuſe, for, were it not wicked reaſoning to ſay, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>of, and to Beleevers.</hi> Rom. 14, 10, 12. <hi>VVee ſhall All ſtand before the</hi> Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat <hi>of Chriſt. So that every one of us ſhall give an account of himſelf to God. Therefore, that he dyed for All, and wee muſt All appear before the Judgement-ſeat of Chriſt, is meant of the Beleevers, and the Elect onely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To prove the Aſſumption, is cited.</hi> Joh. 14.17. <hi>Even the Spirit of Truth, whom the VVorld cannot receive, &amp;c.</hi> verſ. 22. Judas <hi>ſaith unto him (not Iſcariot,) Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf to us, and not unto the world;</hi> and 17.9. I <hi>pray not for the</hi> World, <hi>But for them which thou haſt given mee, for they are thine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Theſe places ſpeakes not of the <hi>Ranſome and Propitiation only,</hi> nor yet for that, and the fruits thereof only, but alſo of higher Communication of Spirit and Priviledges, <hi>which Jeſus Chriſt, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his blood, (both as the ranſome, &amp; as the ſeal of the New Teſtament) with which he is aſcended, doth from his Fathers right hand, ſend forth to thoſe that are Called, &amp; doe beleeve on him, and to no other; though in the Counſell of God elected. So that theſe Places prove not the Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but are abuſed in being cited to it, without any diſtinction, whereas Chriſt in the Scripture, maketh a diſtinction of—theſe things.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38, 39. <hi>and</hi> 3.12. as is ſhewne, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.2.3. <hi>before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:113535:61"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither doe theſe places ſay, <hi>the World of the wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men,</hi> as the Aſſumption doth, and incited them to it, would have them underſtand where, if by <hi>wicked and ungodly,</hi> be meant the ſeed <hi>of the Serpent;</hi> which with an Emphaſis, are ſo called, Then it overthrows the Propoſition, and concluſion: and intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth what it openly denies; For they are therefore even ſo called, the wicked and ungodly, and <hi>of the wicked One,</hi> becauſe they have refuſed to come in to God by: yea, have deſpiſed and abuſed thoſe mercies and meanes Procured for, and extended to them, through the Death and Ranſome of Chriſt for them, and accompanied with ſome gift of his Spirit, to turne them in to God, as is evident by comparing <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.3.7, 16. with 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2, 3, 5. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18, 19, 20. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23.25. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51.</p>
                  <p>But if by <hi>wicked and ungodly,</hi> be meant, <hi>the world of Mankind,</hi> as they are Naturall men, and unconverted, Then it either excludes many of them from being wicked and ungodly, in any ſenſe, and ſo contradicts the Scripture. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. or elſe ſhuts them out, all, and every one, (Elect as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,) from being of the number of them, <hi>for whom Chriſt dyed;</hi> for they all are uncapable of receiving that Portion of Spirit here promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Nor are ſuch manifeſtations and Priviledges here meant for any (though Elect,) till they firſt ſo beleeve in Chriſt, <hi>that they love him.</hi> Joh. 7.38, 39. 1 Cor. 2.9, 15. and howſoever this Aſſumption mingles Naturall men together with, and makes them one with the <hi>Seed of the Serpent,</hi> and ſo ſinfully abuſeth the Places cited; by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

Prov.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.31, 32. but if then they refuſe, and harden their hearts againſt it, that is great condemnation, and if they ſo perſiſt, it endangers them to be given up of God; and then there will be no Remedy, but they will be judged to a <hi>ſecond death,</hi> by him that hath dyed for them, and now calleth them, and they will none of his Counſell. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23, 25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.21. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8.</p>
                  <p>And all this is true Goſpel, whether men beleeve it, or beleeve it not, and on this ground, and preſſing all this as the Truth, and Oracles of God, are all men to be exhorted to Repentance of their ſinnes, to faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo to be reconciled to God. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. and 3.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15, 19, 30.</p>
                  <p>And till by the Spirit in this Goſpel, men be made Penitent, and brought in to beleeve in Chriſt, they are no better then naturall men, and of the world, (though Elect,) and ſo uncapable of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of Spirit, and manifeſtations as theſe. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.17, 22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. which is alſo to be could them, to bring them to Repentance and faith. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37, 38.</p>

                  <p>If to poſſeſſe men of the Inheritance, had been the firſt and onely end of Chriſt his Death and Ranſome; there might have been ſome colour to have pauſed on this bould and falſe aſſertion; But that is already proved falſe, in Chap. 2. and in Anſwer to the third Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and elſe-where.</p>

Iſa. 42.1. <hi>Mine Elect, in whom my ſoule delighteth.</hi> And the Spirit ſaith, <hi>He is</hi> (Col. 1.15.) <hi>the Firſt-borne of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>

                  <p>And himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22, 30. <hi>The Lord Poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way, before, &amp;c.

                  <p n="2">2. That in this very Election, God did Elect a certaine number of men. In this his Sonne, and to Sonſhip in him, a Conformity to him, and enjoyment of the Kingdome with him. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That at the ſame Election, God in his love to his Son Chriſt, and thoſe choſen in him; Did appoint a great, yet a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other men, to be Servants to his Sonne Chriſt, and thoſe Choſen in him. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 7.2.11. <hi>and</hi> 119.91. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60.12. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16.27.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That to this end, God did Decree, to creat all Mankind in one <hi>Adam,</hi> and to ſet him forth, as the Firſt man, and a publick Perſon,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:113535:66"/>in the room and place of all Mankind, to ſtand or fall, for all that were by Propagation to come of him, and in this Decree, hee decreed that all the reſt of Mankind, except his Sonne Chriſt, ſhould come forth of this Firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> by Propagation; and in this Decree, hee decreed to make a World of Creatures, for the uſe and ſervice of Mankind, and to doe all this, by and through, and for his Sonne Chriſt. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 18, 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. And,</p>
                  <p>All this Election and Decree was free, and freely decreed by God, without any reſpect, or motion from any fore-ſight, of Good, or evill, righteouſneſſe or ſinne in mankind, or in any of them, one or other.

                  <p n="5">5. That God fore-ſeeing, that the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> would fall, and ſo looſe himſelf, and all that were to come by propagation from him: and ſo all thr Priviledges of both Sonnes and Servants, that were put in his keeping (for Election to Sonneſhip, or appontment to ſervice, were neither in him, nor put in his keeping,) <hi>Did Chooſe, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate, or Preordaine, his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, to be his Servant, by his Death and Reſurrection, to ranſome All men, and recover againe</hi> (<hi>as a Second</hi> Adam,) <hi>the Priviledges both of Sonnes and Servants; And by his Spirit and Power, to make it knowne to them all in Due ſeaſon.</hi> Iſai. 42.1.1 Pet. 1.20. 1 Tim. 2, 4, 5, 6. Heb. 10.5.10.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That GOD in this Decree or Predeſtination: did Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>All</hi> his Elect Sonnes, to the Adoption of Sonnes, and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt.

                  <p>And all the reſidue of the ſonnes of men, He Deſtinated to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to Jeſus Chriſt, and his People: in his Free-will, Not being moved thereto, with reſpect of either good, or evill in Them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12. <hi>and</hi> 14.9, 12.</p>

                  <p n="8">8. God fore-ſeeing, that both Sonnes and Servants, would ſinne againſt theſe meanes, and ſo not come in to the obedience of their Lord, but Rebell againſt him, Hee did freely, yet further Decree. Both:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>To overcome his Elect and Predeſtinate Sonnes, (as Bullocks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed to the yoke,) for the glory of his rich, and Free-Grace in Chriſt: and ſo freely to forgive their diſobedience, and by his Spirit make them willing, and bring them in to his Sonne, and Sanctify and preſerve them in and through his Sunne, and by his grace and Spirit, to His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Jere. 31.18, 20. 2 Tim. 1.9. Tit. 3.3, 4, 5, 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To harden the reſidue, and give them up, for their contempt of the means; and hardning their hearts there-againſt, and reſiſting his Spirit, moving to their hearts, through the meanes: And this for the glory and praiſe of the equity and ſecurity of his Juſtice.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.7, 8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.16.30.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That God decreed his Sonne. Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould be the Lord and diſpoſer of <hi>All,</hi> the Head and Governour of the Church, and Kingdome; and the Judge of <hi>All men.</hi> That by him the glory of all the Kingdome, and Judgement may be given to God. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9.12. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 27.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That all this whole Counſell of God (about Mankind; for There meddle no further) was in himſelf, and open before him, and decreed at once, before the World, or time was, there being neither firſt nor laſt, in reſpect of time in the Decree of God, but onely in Order, one thing decreed for another, though his Decree be larger then Election, and all his Decrees in one, ordered to, and for Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which obtaineth all for the Elected. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.18. <hi>Romanes</hi> 7.11.</p>
                  <p>And yet ſtill agreeing with all hitherto ſaid of Election; I finde mentioned in Scripture an Election not ſo high, as this before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, Namely an Election of ſome to be a Peculiar People, above all the People of the Earth, which though it includes the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Elected, yet it may alſo include more, even ſome of the Servants alſo. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6, 7.</p>
                  <p>And alſo, I find mentioned in Scripture, an Election of ſome, to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:113535:67"/>ſome Peculiar Office for, and Service for, or in the Church, and this alſo includes more then the Prime Elect. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.1, 4. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.70.</p>
                  <p>And both theſe Elections are included in the former Decree, and are from Eternity alſo, but not to the injoyment of the Priviledges; by every one thus Elected, for ever, as the Prime Election, without Controverſie is. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.12. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.18.</p>
                  <p>And I am lead thus to conceive of the Election and Decree of God, both by the Scriptures alledged, and other-like Places, and alſo by Gods working with man, mentioned therein, being aſſured, that God worketh all things <hi>according to the Councell of his own will;</hi> ſo as look how his Word declareth him to proceed in his Workes, wee may be ſure, ſuch was his Purpoſe and Decree. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11.</p>
                  <p>And ſo through this whole diſcourſe it appears, <hi>That the Death and Ranſome of Chriſt for All men,</hi> impeacheth not the Doctrine of Election or Predeſtination, or of Gods ſhewing mercy to whom he will, but agreeth very well therewith: and ſo is the whole Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Onely now I will adde a few things appertaining to this buſineſs, by way of caution.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Prime Election, yea, or Predeſtination to Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Howſoever by way of Intimation, and conſequence, it be found oft; yet in ten times reading, and much ſearching the Scripture, I cannot find it expreſly mentioned, and ſet forth Ten times in all the Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That in reſpect of particulars, It is a Secret with God, till he doe make it knowne, ſo that we can not ſay; This or that man is, or is not Elected; but we may know of, and ſay to any man, <hi>Chriſt Dyed for him, and is the Propitiation for his ſinnes, and if he Repent and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, hee ſhall receive Remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> This being revealed. <hi>Now ſecret thing belongs to the Lord our God, But things revealed, to us and our Children for ever.</hi> Deut. 29.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Howſoever all Gods Counſells ſhall ſtand, yet thoſe that have very well known the ſame, have never made ſuch uſe of it, as to put any impoſſibility upon God, To doe any of his Creatures good: <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> knew ſtones were not Elected, yet (not ſpeaking of Gods Will, but of his Power) He ſaid, <hi>God is able of theſe ſtones,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:113535:68"/>to raiſe up Children unto Abraham.</hi> Matth. 3.9. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the rejected Jewes, ſaith, <hi>God is able to graft them in againe.</hi> Rom. 11.23. and our Saviour would not have his Diſciples to think, That he could not have obtained by Prayer; <hi>more then Twelve Legions of Angels.</hi> Matt. 26.33. and plainly affirmeth to them, <hi>That with God all things are poſſible.</hi> Luk. 19.26.</p>
                  <p>It would therefore be an abuſe of Election, in any ſort to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or weaken the Doctrine of the Goſpel thereby, or the hope it giveth or ſetteth before any.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That in Scripture, there is mentioned an actuall Election, or Choice, which is in time, (though according to that before time,) in which God pulleth and choſeth men from among others, to ſuch good things as hee in his Counſell had prepared for them. <hi>Iſai</hi> 14.1. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 4.9.7. <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.17. and 2.12. And to ſpeak of the choice part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; It's manifeſt ſuch an Election or Choice there is, Not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe meneioned, but ſo mentioned in Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is called, <hi>an Election according to fore-knowledge.</hi> 1 Pet. 12. Foreknowledge in God, ſignifieth even the Prime Election to Sonſhip, when it is diſtinct from, and put before Predeſtination, and elſe-where. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. compared with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5. But when it is ſaid, according to <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> It points out that Worke of God now done, <hi>according to that fore-knowledge of his, which worketh all things according to the Counſell of his own will.</hi> Act. 2.23. and 4.28. &amp; 5.13.18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11, 12. and ſo Election a worke.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That often, no more is mentioned in it, then what the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted doe in ſome meaſure knowingly enjoy. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16, 19. <hi>and</hi> 17.6, 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>and</hi> 2.9. which is not uſuall in the mentioning Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the <hi>Counſel of God.</hi> Rom. 8. Epheſ. 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That this Election is in the heavenly Call; and follows it. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. Reu. 17.14. whereas Election in the Counſell of God is before the Call. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3.4. Yea this Election and Choice doth not alwayes ſo faſten on men, <hi>in the beginning of the Call:</hi> So as they (though Called) can be ſaid to be Choſen. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23, 24. Though ſometime it doth ſo faſten on ſome, in the beginning of the Call, and ſo prevaile alſo, that they are ſaid to be <hi>Choſen from the beginning</hi> (of the Goſpels) <hi>Call unto Salvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth.</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.13,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:113535:68"/>14. 1 Theſſ. 1.3, 4, 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6. and in due Seaſon, it will faſten on all Elected in his Counſell, when they are <hi>Partakers of the Heavenly Call.</hi> Rom. 11.7.2. Tim. 1.9. yet is this actuall Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Worke of GOD, in order of time after the Call.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They that in the <hi>heavenly Call,</hi> are in beleeving, ſo purged with the blood of Chriſt, that they are taken off themſelves, and the World, and united to Chriſt, in confidence, love and delight, ſo as they are given up to him, for all Life, Guidance, Protection, and Hope: are affirmed to be actually <hi>Choſen out of the World unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Joh.</hi> 15.19. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13, 14. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.3, 5.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There have been ſome found, in former and latter times, upon whom this Actuall Election hath paſſed, and they therefore called <hi>Gods Elect and Choſen Generation.</hi> Deut. 6.6, 7. 1 Theſſ. 1.3. 1 Pet. 1.2. Joh. 13.18.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They that are thus actually Choſen, and Prevailed with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, are ſaid to be bieſſed, <hi>and Called, and Choſen, and Faithfull.</hi> Pſal. 65.4. Revel. 17.14.</p>
                  <p>And every one may know himſelf to be Elected in the Councell of God, before time, To all that, <hi>Hee finds himſelf in the Worke of God, Choſen unto in Time.</hi> Ephe. 1.3, 4.11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That in Scripture is mentioned; an actuall refuſall, Preterition or non-Election, according to the <hi>purpoſe of God alſo;</hi> in reſpect of ſome peculiar favour, or Priviledge: which yet may ſtand with Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Sonſhip, and eternall Salvation <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.67, 68.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That in Scripture is mentioned an Actuall Reprobation, and rejection of ſome from the meanes, or from the bleſſing in the meanes of Eternall Life, and ſo from Eternall Life it ſelf; and this for their contempt of the meanes, and reſiſting the holy Ghoſt. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.16, 17, 27, 30. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 35. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, 18.28.</p>
                  <p>The tearme Reprobation, Scarce otherwiſe uſed; and of this Actuall Choice, and Actuall Reprobation, the Scripture moſt ſpeaks; Now the Goſpel of CHRIST is a Truth to be Preached to all; and hope of Life tendered on Beleeving, and after entrance, this actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>Election</hi> to be ſo ſet forth, that men be exhorted to give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, in following the Spirit, to make it ſure; and if any be ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diſobedient: warning given, leaſt by contempt they
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:113535:69"/>procure to themſelves actuall Reprobation: which uſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes of them, and ſo they are very uſefull to further the Goſpel; which (by abuſe,) This Objection turnes them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</p>

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>This ſober Objection doth not denie <hi>the Death of Chriſt for All men;</hi> But onely ſeems to deny his Ranſome and Mediation, <hi>for All Men.</hi> Though indeed, as he is ſet forth in Scripture, <hi>Hee ſhould not be the Lord of All men: nor challenge their ſubmiſſion, and living to him; Nor ſhew mercy, nor offer hope of life to them, nor convince them of ſinne for not beleeving on him, nor raiſe them out of their graves, nor cauſe them to confeſſe him Lord; nor judge them according to the Goſpel;</hi> if hee had not Ranſomed them, and paid the Price; and mediated for them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1 4.8, 9, 10, 12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10, 14, 15, 19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>But the Anſwer to this Objection, is eaſie and plain in Scripture: for as the Mediation of CHRIST, is both more generall, and more ſpeciall; more generall, <hi>as Hee is the One</hi> MEDIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOUR <hi>between God and man.</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. more ſpeciall; <hi>as hee is the Mediatour of the New Teſtament, &amp;c. That they which are Called
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:113535:69"/>might receive the Promiſe of Eternall Inheritance.</hi> Heb. 9.14. according to that is ſaid, <hi>Hee is the Saviour of All men: ſpecially of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi> 1 Tim. 4.10.</p>
                  <p>So as in all the Offices of Chriſt, as the Prieſt, the Prophet, the King; there is both that which is more generall, and alſo that which is more ſpeciall and Peculiar.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As a Prieſt hee offered Sacrifice, in reſpect of one end; That is, <hi>Propitiation for All men:</hi> Heb. 9.26. and 2.9. <hi>Io. r.</hi> 29. 1 Joh. 2.2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of all the ends, <hi>Propitiation,</hi> and <hi>Sealing the New Teſtament, and Teſtification to the Truth,</hi> and of the uttermoſt end in all; <hi>for his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and and Choſen Ones.</hi> Heb. 9.14, 15. Matt. 26.26. <hi>As the High-Prieſt, at his Fathers Right-hand, hee in ſome ſort interceeds, and puts in for Tranſgreſſors, and the World.</hi> Iſai. 53.12. Joh. 17.21, 23. but his ſpeciall buſineſſe, and Advocation, is <hi>for his Called and Choſen ones.</hi> Hebr. 3.1.6, 8. 1 Joh. 2.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the great Prophet, hee calls all men, <hi>and enlightens every one that comes into the World.</hi> Prov. 8.4.32. Iſai. 45.22. Joh. 1.4, 5, 6. But makes knowne his Fathers Name, Words and Gouncells, in the ſecret of the Covenant, onely <hi>to his Called and Choſen ones. Ioh.</hi> 15, 16, 19, 20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.13.15.17. <hi>and</hi> 6.7, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As the King, <hi>Hee ruleth over all.</hi> Pſal. 103.19. <hi>and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince All men of ſinne, for not beleeving in him.</hi> Joh. 16.8.11. <hi>and Judge all, even ſuch as would not that Hee ſhould Reigne over them.</hi> Acts. 17.31. Luke 19.27. But he enters in by the <hi>Spirit, and Rules in the hearts of his</hi> Choſen Ones. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. and <hi>freeth them of their dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and bonds.</hi> Rom. 7.25. <hi>and</hi> 8.2. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.12. <hi>and leads them.</hi> Rom. 8.14. <hi>and overthrowes their Enemies.</hi> Mich. 7.18, 20. Rom. 16, 20. <hi>Enriches them with Spirituall bleſſings.</hi> Epheſ. 1.3. <hi>and will plead their Cauſe, and give them the Kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So at this is a motive to <hi>all men,</hi> to ſeek Him, and learne of Him, and come in, and ſubmit to him; This Argument confirming that which it ſeems to oppoſe.</p>

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>This Objection denieth neither the Death nor Ranſom of Chriſt to be <hi>for all men;</hi> But onely any intendment of Life, and ſaving Grace thereby: neither doth it bend force to denye, That, for any, but onely theſe, where the Declaration of the Goſpel, is not granted, and the force of the Objection is weake.</p>
                  <p>For 1. The Scripture hath expreſly affirmed Gods intention to be, <hi>that they all might be ſaved, and repent, and beleeve, and to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaved.</hi> Ezek. 33.11. Joh. 3.17.1.4, 7. Rom. 2.4. 1 Tim. 2.4. 2 Pet. 3.9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If wee cannot in the Workes of God, ſee a fulfilling of the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God, <q>It becomes us to admire his Wiſedome, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to bewaile our ignorance, and waite and ſupplicate for Light from him, and not by raſh judgeing and miſtaking of his Workes, to denie the truth of his Words. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33, 34.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Scripture teſtifieth that God hath, and doth uſe ſome meanes towards <hi>all men,</hi> not onely in his Workes of Creation and Providence; which giveth ſome Teſtimony of his Goodneſſe, to lead to Repentance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.16, 17. and 17.26. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. and 2.4. but with ſome further Light: yea, it may be, ſome rumour of the Goſpel (as much as drew <hi>Rahab</hi> to beleeve,) for was it not declared to all the World? <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.15. Did not <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah,</hi> and the long lived Fathers, and <hi>Noahs</hi> Preaching, and <hi>Arke-building;</hi> ſpread the fame through the World? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20. after the Flood, was is not declared by <hi>Noah,</hi> to all the world? <hi>Gen.</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:113535:70"/>8.9. Did not <hi>Sem</hi> live to <hi>Abrahams</hi> time? and (whether it were hee or no?) was not <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> a Prieſt then living? Did not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> travell? and <hi>Iſraels,</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſpread farre? Did <hi>Joh,</hi> and his three Freinds, and <hi>Elihu,</hi> in their ſeverall Countrys, nothing this way? Did not <hi>Davids</hi> friendſhip with divers Kings, <hi>Solomons</hi> Reigne over divers Countreys, the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> comming and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Solomon;</hi> ſpread the fame of the Goſpel? Did not the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities and diſperſion of the Jewes: The advancement of <hi>Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiab</hi> and <hi>Mordecai;</hi> make ſome ſpread of this knowledge? Was not our Saviours Starre ſeen in the <hi>Eaſt?</hi> Were not the Jewes in all Countreys at the comming of Chriſt? And doth not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſay expreſly, <hi>their ſound went out into all the Earth, and their words to the ends of the world.</hi> Rom. 10.18. And ſhall any of us ſay, God hath uſed no meanes to lead them to ſeek him, becauſe wee know not of it; farre be ſuch raſhneſſe from us, to contradict the Scripture. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.17. neither doth <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. ſay, he hath uſed no means with them, but onely not ſuch, and ſo great meanes: He hath not dealt ſo with any Nation, as hee did with Iſrael; nor then had he; but that is not uſed no meanes at all:</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Gods deniall of his Servants to preach in ſome places for a time, as in <hi>Act.</hi> 16.6, 7. proves not an utter deniall of all meanes to them: for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God might have formerly uſed means, which for their contempt of: the greater might now be denied to them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.12. &amp; 25.29.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God may deny the meanes for one time, and grant it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Samaritans:</hi> denyed. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5. but gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This deniall might be in mercy; it may be God had not yet prepared them to receive the Goſpel, and ſo they might violently have reſiſted it, and procured a curſe, and God would after prepare them, and then they ſhould receive it. <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.5, 6. It might be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Jewes amongſt them, that now would have ſtoned theſe Apoſtles, that ſhould after receive the Goſpel; as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> once; ſtoning after receiving: But this is certaine, Gods time was not yet come, and ſome other were to have the Goſpell before them: that yet had it not, ſuitable to that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.22.</p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:113535:71"/>
                  <p n="4">4. Both Jewes and Gentiles there, not long after both, had the Goſpel: and many received it; and obtained like precious Faith with the Apoſtles. <hi>Acts.</hi> 19.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. So that this Objection hath loſt all his ſtrength.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Yet GOD may holily and juſtly denie the cleer Revelation of the Goſpel to ſome, and their Poſterity alſo, when they have reſiſted the light in the leſſer meanes, uſed before, eſpecially when they have contemned the greater meanes alſo, when offered, and hardned their hearts from profiting thereby; Hee may then denie thoſe meanes to Father and Children alſo, that walke in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wayes: yea, and harden their hearts from Profiting by ſuch meanes as are left them: And this is a good warning to others, to take heed of any ſleighting and abuſing any meanes, much more to heed that the Goſpel be not abuſed and ſleighted; But no Proofs that God never uſed meanes, to thoſe ſo deprived and hardned; for why then did he deprive and harden them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, 24. <hi>Act.</hi> 28.25, 28. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37, 38. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20, 21, 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>And thus have I anſwered all that I have found of any force, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as for that fooliſh and ſenſeleſſe Cavill: That this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that JESUS CHRIST <hi>Dyed for All men;</hi> Importeth, That all men have Free-will by Nature to ſeek and receive him. It is ſo falſe and groundleſſe a fancy, as needeth no Anſwer; yet when ſuch as ſay, Hee dyed not for <hi>All men,</hi> doe prove thoſe (they beleeve hee did Dye for:) have ſuch Free-will by Nature; That alſo ſhall be Anſwered.</p>

In Anſwer of Objection the Fift. But where this Election and Decree is ſet forth under this terme of <hi>being given to Chriſt,</hi> is hard to find in Scripture; I cannot yet meet with two places, nor with any that could ſhew me them, and prove it ſo. But ſurely in this place it neither is, nor can be taken, as ſo uſed; Though ſuch a groundleſſe apprehenſion thereof, is that, whence ſome doe raiſe to themſelves this Doubt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>And thus did God give <hi>All Men</hi> to Chriſt, to Ranſome them; <hi>and pay the price for them, and ſo worke a Redemption for them, that they might be ſet alive before him.</hi> Iſai. 49.6.

Between the juſtification of Chriſt, as the <hi>Publick Perſon,</hi> in the room of <hi>All men,</hi> and giving it into his hands to diſpence: and the juſtification of men by and through Chriſt, in his diſpenſation. 4 Between a ſalvation obtained by Chriſt, and a poſſibility of mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaved, and the door and way of Salvation opened for them: And this ſalvation communicated unto them, and they brought in, and eternally ſaved. The firſt of every of theſe is true in Chriſt, for <hi>all Men:</hi> Though the latter be yet wanting to moſt men: and this is alſo evident by the Change of Perſons and expreſſions, and <hi>Tence,</hi> the Scriptures uſeth. 1.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:113535:103"/>Satisfaction, and Ranſome, Jeſus Chriſt did beare all, and Paid the whole debt, That he might have Power, to free in his Seaſon; and according to his and his Fathers will.</p>
               <p>And that his Seaſon is not in this life, to take all weakneſſe and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity, no not from his owne; and that beſides; He will, and doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict puniſhments even on them, for their out-goings from his grace.</p>
               <p>I ſee no difference here in the intention or Subſtance of the Doctrine or iſſue of the buſineſſe in both theſe ſayings; but they may well ſtand without contention.</p>
               <p>Nor can the firſt of theſe ſayings be paralleld with that I called the ſayings of Papiſts; for 1. Here is mentioned ſome part of puniſhment to be ſuffered in this life, with an affirmation onely, to be ſuffered Here, which ſufferings are alſo granted in the others ſayings, whereas the Papiſts affirme a part to be ſuffered, without ſuch reſtrictions: So as if not all ſuffered here: It ſhould remaine to be ſuffered in their deviſed Purgatory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here theſe Sayings are not ſaid to be Satisfactory, and Propitiatory, as the Papiſts imply, and ſay in their Affirmation: and the Sufferings themſelves are alſo granted in the other ſayings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ground of the Papiſts aſſertion, is to ſtrengthen the opinion of Propitiatory Sacrifices, to be offered by the Prieſts, and the opinion of Purgatory, and the practiſes of Prayers and Sacrifices for the dead: whereas the former of theſe ſayings; yeelds no colour for ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and the latter yeelds all the Sufferings.</p>
               <p>Yet have I inclined to the latter ſaying, without thought of any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but onely in the Expreſſion: The firſt, coupling both the ends of the Death and Ranſome of Chriſt: and the ſecond diſtinguiſhing ſpeakes of the firſt end only: which I being treating of; I had cauſe to incline to ſpeake in that manner; That thoſe that affirme, that all that Chriſt dyed for, are juſtified by his blood, and ſhalbe ſaved from wrath through him, might ſee what is in their ſaying, and ſuch I leave to prove their aſſertion, which I know they cannot, or to free themſelves from being ſnared with that Popiſh opinion, which I know they would be glad to doe, and to them onely, it belongeth to doe it.</p>
               <p>And ſo having no intention of blemiſhing a good ſaying, nor conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding without cauſe, but only to maintain the truth againſt falſhood, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
